# Adventurer's Ring

Source: *Unknown*

Ring, Common

"Lamps are a liability on adventures. Delicate and prone to oil spillage, lamps fill a hand that should otherwise be wielding a weapon or casting a spell. Once you try one of our elegant and practical rings, you’ll never go back to cumbersome flint and fire."

While the cover on this ring is open, the ring produces a flame that creates no heat and consumes no fuel. It sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. As a Bonus Action, you can close the cover, smothering the flame, or open it again.
