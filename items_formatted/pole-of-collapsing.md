# Pole of Collapsing

Source: *Unknown*

Wondrous Item, Common

This item functions as a Pole. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to collapse it into a 1-foot-long rod for ease of storage (the pole’s weight doesn’t change) or cause the 1-foot-long rod to revert to a Pole. The rod elongates only as far as the surrounding space allows.
