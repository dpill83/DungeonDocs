# Instrument of Scribing

Source: *Unknown*

Wondrous Item, Common

This musical instrument has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are playing it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a Bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical Darkness. Casting the
Dispel Magic
spell on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.
