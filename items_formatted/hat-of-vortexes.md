# Hat of Vortexes

Source: *Unknown*

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (requires attunement)

This hat has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge while holding the hat to release a magical vortex from it. The vortex fills a 10-foot Cube originating from you and lasts for 1 hour. While the vortex is present, its area is Difficult Terrain.
You decide a vortex’s visual details when you create it. For instance, the vortex might be multicolored or glittery.
