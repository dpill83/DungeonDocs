Domestic Wonder (Uncommon)
. This bipedal wonder is designed to assist with household duties. It vaguely resembles whatever species its creator used as inspiration. An activated domestic wonder uses the Domestic Wonder stat block. The wonder is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the wonder shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger. The domestic wonder is destroyed if it drops to 0 Hit Points.

In combat, the wonder shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger. The flying wonder is destroyed if it drops to 0 Hit Points.
Gyrocopter Wonder (Rare).
This wagon-sized vehicle is made of brassy metal and has a spiral-shaped propeller atop it. Its midsection is open on two sides. Once wound, the gyrocopter wonder remains active for 8 hours. While active, the gyrocopter can be used as a vehicle; it requires one pilot.
The gyrocopter wonder is a Huge object that weighs 500 pounds and has the following statistics: AC 14, HP 50, Speed 5 ft., and Fly Speed 20 ft. The gyrocopter can bear up to 2,000 pounds of cargo; if it bears any more than this, it deactivates.
Eight spectral cords are mounted to the inside of the cargo bay. A creature riding in the gyrocopter wonder can take a Utilize action to attach itself to or detach itself from one of these cords. A creature attached to a cord can leap from the gyrocopter wonder and glide, moving up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air. If a creature attached to a cord is ever more than 500 feet away from the gyrocopter, the cord immediately disappears and returns to the wonder.

Once wound, the mobility wonder transforms into a personal transport device and remains active for 24 hours. While active, the mobility wonder increases your Speed to 30 feet.
