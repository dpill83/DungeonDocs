# Mythallar Cloak

Source: *Unknown*

Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement)

This electric-blue cloak is studded with sewn-in crystals that are shards of a decommissioned mythallar. The cloak has 10 charges and regains 1d10 expended charges daily at dawn.
While wearing the cloak, you can take a Bonus Action and expend 1 charge to activate the cloak’s magic. The magic lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early (no action required).
While the cloak’s magic is active, you gain a Fly Speed of 30 feet and can hover. Additionally, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d4 Radiant damage. If you are aloft when the cloak’s magic ends, you fall.
