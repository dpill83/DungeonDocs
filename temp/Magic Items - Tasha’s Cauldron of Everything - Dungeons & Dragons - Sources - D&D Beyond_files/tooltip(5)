Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</p><p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p><p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p><p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p><p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n","SimpleOrAdvanced":"simple","Url":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/4/tooltip?callback=window.CurseTips['waterdeep-tooltip'].handleTooltipData"})
