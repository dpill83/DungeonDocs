# Calimemnon Crystal

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This immaculately cut sixty-sided diamond fits in one hand, yet it contains an entire genie empire. The Calimemnon Crystal was made by high elf magic to imprison the notorious genie lords Calim and Memnon, who once ruled and warred over what is now Calimshan.
When viewed by a creature with Truesight, the normally beautiful diamond is a grotesque sight: trapped within the gemstone are more than a hundred genies, including the physical forms of Calim and Memnon. The genies scream and strain in agonized fury, pressing their belligerent faces against the walls of their crystalline prison.

Aura of Cold.
The temperature drops precipitously in a 20-foot Emanation originating from the crystal. Whenever the Emanation enters a creature’s space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature takes 2d6 Cold damage. A creature takes this damage only once per turn. While attuned to the crystal, you are unaffected by the aura, and you can take a Magic action to disable or enable the aura.
Healing/Damage Rays.
While holding the crystal, you can take a Magic action to fire six rays of volatile energy from the crystal at one or more creatures within 60 feet. You can aim the rays at one target or at several. For each ray, choose one of the following effects:
Damage Ray.
The target makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 + 6 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Healing Ray.
The target regains 2d6 + 2 Hit Points.
This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
