# Mithral Armor

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.
