# Mithral Armor

Source: *Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)*

Armor, Uncommon

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.
