Rod, Legendary (requires attunement)

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can cast one of the following spells from it:
Heal
(expends 1 charge) or
Resurrection
(expends 5 charges).
The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
