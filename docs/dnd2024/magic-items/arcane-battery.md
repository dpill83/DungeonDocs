# Arcane Battery

Source: *Netherdeep*

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This smooth, oval stone is etched with faintly glowing, magical symbols. While holding the battery, you can take a Magic action to touch the battery to one magic item. If that magic item normally regains expended charges daily, it immediately regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges, and the battery loses its magic.
