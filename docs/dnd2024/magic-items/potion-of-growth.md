# Potion Of Growth

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the
Enlarge/Reduce
spell for 10 minutes (no Concentration required).
The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
