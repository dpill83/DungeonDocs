Coven Sensor.
The
Hag Eye
is usually entrusted to a hag’s minion for safekeeping and transport. As a Magic action, a hag who belongs to the coven that created the
Hag Eye
can see what the
Hag Eye
sees if the hag and the
Hag Eye
are on the same plane of existence. This effect lasts as long as the hag maintains Concentration. Multiple hags in the coven can see through the
Hag Eye
simultaneously.
Creating a Hag Eye.
Only a hag coven can craft this item, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or another wearable item. A hag coven can have only one
Hag Eye
at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a special rite. This rite takes 1 hour, and the hags can’t perform it if one or more of them has the Incapacitated condition. If the hags take any other actions during this rite, the rite fails and ends.
