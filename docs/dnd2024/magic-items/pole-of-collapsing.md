# Pole Of Collapsing

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This item functions as a Pole. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to collapse it into a 1-foot-long rod for ease of storage (the pole’s weight doesn’t change) or cause the 1-foot-long rod to revert to a Pole. The rod elongates only as far as the surrounding space allows.
