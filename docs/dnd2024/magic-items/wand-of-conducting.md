# Wand Of Conducting

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to 120 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.
Regaining Charges.
The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
