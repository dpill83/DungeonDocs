Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)
Crude metal spikes adorn this magic Shield. It has the following properties that you can use while holding it.
Shield Bash.
When you take the Attack action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Piercing damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier.
Spike Salvo.
As a Magic action, you can cause spikes to erupt from the Shield in a 30-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
