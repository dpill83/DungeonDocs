# Cape Of The Mountebank

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast
Dimension Door
as a Magic action. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is Lightly Obscured by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
