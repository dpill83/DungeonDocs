# Cape of the Mountebank

Source: *Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)*

Wondrous Item, Rare

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast
Dimension Door
as a Magic action. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is Lightly Obscured by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
