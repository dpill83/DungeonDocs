# Potion Of Longevity

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a
Potion of Longevity
, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years.
Suspended in this amber liquid is a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
