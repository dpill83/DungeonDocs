# Pipe of Smoke Monsters

Source: *Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)*

Wondrous Item, Common

While smoking this pipe, you can take a Magic action to exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a creature, such as a dragon, a flumph, or a slaad. The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube and loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordinary puff of smoke.
