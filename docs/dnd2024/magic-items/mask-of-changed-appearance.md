# Mask Of Changed Appearance

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This jeweled mask has 3 charges. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 charge and change your face’s appearance. You can’t make yourself look like a different person, but you can smooth or deepen your wrinkles, whiten your teeth, hide or accentuate bags under your eyes, or perform other minor cosmetic changes. While your appearance is changed, the mask has the Invisible condition. Your changed appearance lasts 1 hour.
Regaining Charges.
The mask regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the mask explodes in a harmless cloud of sweet-swelling powder and is destroyed.
