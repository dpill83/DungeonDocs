# Cap of Water Breathing

Source: *Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)*

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

While wearing this cap underwater, you can take a Magic action to create a bubble of air around your head. This bubble allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until the cap is removed or you are no longer underwater.
