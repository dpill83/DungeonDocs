# Cap Of Water Breathing

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


While wearing this cap underwater, you can take a Magic action to create a bubble of air around your head. This bubble allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until the cap is removed or you are no longer underwater.
