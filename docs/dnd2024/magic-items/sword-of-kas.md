Weapon, Artifact (requires attunement)

Kas was a powerful warrior who served Vecna and whose loyalty was rewarded with this sword. As Kas’s power grew, so did his hubris. The sword urged Kas to destroy Vecna and usurp his throne. Legend says Vecna’s destruction came at Kas’s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant’s doom, leaving only Kas’s sword behind.
Bloodthirst.
The sword thirsts for blood. If the sword doesn’t taste blood on its blade within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 Psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the
Dominate Monster
spell, and the sword demands blood. The spell effect ends when the sword’s demand is met.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword, which scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20 and deals an extra 2d10 Slashing damage to Undead.

Personality.
The sword’s purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna’s worshipers, destroying the lich’s works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.
The
Sword of Kas
also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the
Eye and Hand of Vecna
.
Destroying the Sword.
A creature attuned to both the
Eye of Vecna
and the
Hand of Vecna
can use the
Wish
property of those combined Artifacts to unmake the
Sword of Kas
, provided the sword is within 30 feet of the spell’s caster. Upon casting Wish, the creature makes a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, nothing happens, and the Wish spell is wasted. On a successful save, the
Sword of Kas
is destroyed.
