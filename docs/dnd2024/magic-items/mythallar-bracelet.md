Wondrous Item, Common

Three small, crystal beads made from a decommissioned mythallar are strung on this leather bracelet. As a Magic action, you can pluck one bead from the bracelet to gain Advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks for 1 minute.
A bead disappears immediately after it’s plucked. Once all three beads have been plucked, the bracelet loses its magic.
