# Fork Of Eddy Summoning

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This Tiny tuning fork crackles with harmless, multicolored magical energy. As a Magic action, you can tap the fork against any object to summon an Eldritch Eddy (see Netheril's Fall). The eddy appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The eddy is Friendly to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail to command it, the eddy defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions. It takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The eddy disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The fork can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
