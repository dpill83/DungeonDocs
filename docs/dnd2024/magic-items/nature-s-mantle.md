Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Druid or Ranger)
This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid and Ranger spells.
While you are in an area that is Lightly Obscured, you can Hide as a Bonus Action even if you are being directly observed.
