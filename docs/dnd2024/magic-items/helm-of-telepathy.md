<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast
Detect Thoughts
or
Suggestion
(save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can’t be cast from it again until the next dawn.
