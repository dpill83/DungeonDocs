# Prosthetic Limb

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This magic item replaces a lost limb - a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as a Magic action, and it can’t be removed against your will while you are alive.
