# Potion Of Invisibility

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink the potion, you have the Invisible condition for 1 hour. The effect ends early if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
