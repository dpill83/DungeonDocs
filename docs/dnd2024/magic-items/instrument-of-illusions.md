# Instrument of Illusions

Source: *Dungeon Master's Guide (2024)*

Wondrous Item, Common

While you are playing this musical instrument, you can take a Magic action to create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot Emanation originating from the instrument. If you are a Bard, the size of the Emanation increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.
