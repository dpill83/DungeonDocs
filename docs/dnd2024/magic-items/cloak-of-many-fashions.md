# Cloak Of Many Fashions

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


While wearing this cloak, you can take a Bonus Action to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the garment. The cloak’s weight doesn’t change. Regardless of its appearance, the cloak can’t be anything but a cloak. Although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic cloaks, it doesn’t gain their magical properties.
