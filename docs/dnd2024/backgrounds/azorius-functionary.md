# Azorius Functionary

*Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica (Legacy).*

The brutes are at the gate, chaos is looming, and the only thing standing in the way of disaster is the foundation of law and order - as embodied in the Azorius Senate. You're a proud member of the Azorius guild, which both enacts and enforces the laws that make Ravnican society function smoothly and safely.

Contacts The Azorius Senate is a sprawling bureaucracy<br>and people in a variety of positions throughout the guild can pull strings to make things happen. Because of the guild's role in making<br>enforcing laws for the entire city<br>your place in the Azorius can easily bring you into contact with members of other guilds<br>for good or ill.

Non-Azorius Contacts d10 Contact 1 Roll an additional Azorius contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival. 2 The person who recruited me into the Azorius left<br>joined the Boros. 3 I have a friendship with a Dimir agent who sometimes funnels me secrets about Azorius activities. 4 A Golgari spore druid would love to see me slip up<br>break the law. 5 A lesser Gruul chieftain seems to think I could be useful. 6 The black sheep of my family is putting their maniacal genius to use in the Izzet. 7 I'm friends with an Orzhov advokist; we compare notes on different forms of law magic. 8 I was ridiculed once in a Rakdos performance; the performer was impressed with my good humor about it<br>now does me occasional favors. 9 I have a fanatical Selesnya cousin who keeps trying to recruit me<br>everyone else in the family. 10 While growing up<br>I was bullied by a brat who's now a hybrid in the Simic Combine. |
