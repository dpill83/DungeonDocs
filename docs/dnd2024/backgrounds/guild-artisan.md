<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

You are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right.

You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying<br>selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another<br>by ship<br>wagon<br>or caravan<br>or bought them from traveling traders<br>sold them in your own little shop. In some ways<br>the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan. Rather than proficiency with artisan's tools<br>you might be proficient with navigator's tools or an additional language. And instead of artisan's tools<br>you can start with a mule<br>a cart. Guild Business Guild Business Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However<br>your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly. d20 Guild Business 1 Alchemists<br>apothecaries 2 Armorers<br>locksmiths<br>and finesmiths 3 Brewers<br>distillers<br>and vintners 4 Calligraphers<br>scribes<br>and scriveners 5 Carpenters<br>roofers<br>and plasterers 6 Cartographers<br>surveyors<br>and chart-makers 7 Cobblers<br>shoemakers 8 Cooks<br>bakers 9 Glassblowers<br>glaziers 10 Jewelers<br>gemcutters 11 Leatherworkers<br>skinners<br>and tanners 12 Masons<br>stonecutters 13 Painters<br>limners<br>and sign-makers 14 Potters<br>tile-makers 15 Shipwrights<br>sailmakers 16 Smiths<br>metal-forgers 17 Tinkers<br>pewterers<br>and casters 18 Wagon-makers<br>wheelwrights 19 Weavers<br>dyers 20 Woodcarvers<br>coopers<br>and bowyers As a member of your guild<br>you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's tools)<br>as well as the principles of trade<br>good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure<br>or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring<br>trade together. Guild Membership As an established<br>respected member of a guild<br>you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging<br>food if necessary<br>and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities<br>towns<br>a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession<br>which can be a good place to meet potential patrons<br>allies<br>or hirelings. Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime<br>your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild<br>if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments<br>you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.
