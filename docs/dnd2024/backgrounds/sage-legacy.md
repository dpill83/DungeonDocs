Usually<br>this information comes from a library<br>scriptorium<br>university<br>or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place<br>or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.
