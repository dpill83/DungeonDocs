# Boros Legionnaire

*Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica (Legacy).*

As a member of the Boros Legion, your life is devoted to the service of angels and consecrated to the work of establishing justice and peace on the streets of Ravnica. You might be a true believer, inspired by the example of the angels, moved by the plight of the downtrodden, and devoted to the cause of justice. Or you could be a cynic in the ranks, perhaps because you reluctantly followed in the footsteps of a Boros parent, succumbed to the persuasion of a charismatic recruiter's lofty promises, or were drawn in by the prospect of a life of action.

Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Justice. Achieving justice requires establishing fair<br>equitable<br>and compassionate relationships within a community. (Good) 3 Protection. It isn't right for innocents to suffer because of the arrogance of the powerful. (Good) 4 Solidarity.

Contacts The ordered structure of the Boros Legion offers abundant opportunities to make friends -<br>rivals - in higher places. You might have close friends in other guilds that share the Boros emphasis on order<br>community<br>or bitter enemies among the guilds that represent chaos<br>destruction.
