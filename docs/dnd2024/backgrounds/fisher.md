You have spent your life aboard fishing vessels or combing the shallows for the bounty of the ocean. Perhaps you were born into a family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your village. Maybe the job was a means to an end - a way out of an undesirable circumstance that forced you to take up life aboard a ship. Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with the sea, the art of fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon.

As such<br>most fishers have a strong work ethic<br>and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious<br>forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish<br>and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood.
