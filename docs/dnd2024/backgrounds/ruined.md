# Ruined

*Source: (Legacy).*

Everything was going so well! You had a life of luxury, love, and comfort when you suddenly lost it all. Perhaps you were framed for crimes you didn’t commit and lost your reputation, fortune, and career. Maybe a rampaging dragon or another monster wiped out everything you had in a single calamitous afternoon. Or you might have sought out a Deck of Many Things, hoping to make your successful life even more glorious—only to draw a destructive card that changed your destiny forever.
Your desperation has driven you to the career of adventurer. You don’t seek out dark dungeons and their monstrous inhabitants for excitement and glory; you do it because every other path is closed to you. But you have risen high on fortune’s wheel once before, and with luck and fortitude, you could do so again.

Building a Ruined Character Ruined characters were on top of the world before misfortune struck. Many were wealthy. Others come from modest backgrounds<br>but they were surrounded by friends<br>family<br>and loved ones. They might have been famous<br>or simply never encountered serious hardship before. Some were born to privilege or rose to prominence through trickery or a false reputation. Now a Deck of Many Things—or another calamity—has knocked them down like a house of cards. If your character’s life was ruined by a Deck of Many Things<br>consider which card was responsible. Perhaps your character was imprisoned for years by the Donjon or Void card<br>and now everyone they knew has died. Maybe your character drew the Rogue card<br>and the person closest to them—a spouse<br>child<br>or parent—turned against them. A devil unleashed by the Flames card might have destroyed their life. The Ruin or Talons card might have stolen the character’s material goods or saddled them with vast debt. Suggested Characteristics. Rising above misfortune shapes one’s perspective. The Ruined Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character (and ruinous cards that might have prompted this trait).
