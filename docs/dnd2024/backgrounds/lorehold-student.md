Lorehold Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Comprehend Languages <br>Identify 2nd Borrowed Knowledge <br>Locate Object 3rd Speak with Dead <br>Spirit Guardians 4th Arcane Eye <br>Stone Shape 5th Flame Strike <br>Legend Lore Consider customizing how your spells look when you can cast them. Your Lorehold spells might create displays of golden light. You might use a tome or a scroll as a spellcasting focus<br>and your spell effects might reflect the appearance of the reference books you study. Building a Lorehold Character Any class or subclass that deals with knowledge of the past can be a good fit for Lorehold. Bards thrive in Lorehold<br>and Wizards (particularly those of the School of Divination ) are numerous among its students. Clerics (often with the Knowledge or Light domains) are also quite common. For a more unusual take on a Lorehold student<br>you could consider playing a Barbarian with a primal connection to the past (perhaps adopting the Path of the Ancestral Guardian ) or a Paladin whose Oath of the Ancients gives a concrete link to history. Suggested Characteristics. Methodical historians<br>daring adventurers alike can be found among the ranks of Lorehold college. The Lorehold Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character. Lorehold Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation<br>the better. 2 By searching for these lost artifacts<br>I hope to find who I really am along the way. 3 I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head<br>and it needs to be let out somewhere! 4 The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates. 5 I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together<br>and I'm a mess. 6 In the end<br>it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday. Lorehold Trinkets. When you make your character<br>you may roll once on the Lorehold Trinkets table<br>instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook <br>for your starting trinket. Lorehold Trinkets d6 Trinket 1 A map made of concentric circles that can be rotated around the page 2 A puzzle box bedecked with amber 3 A dented brass compass with a red needle 4 The head of a broken statue that houses the consciousness of a snarky sage 5 A sheet of parchment embossed with Tactile lettering<br>glowing red 6 A broken dagger with a wavy blade<br>a serpentine hilt |
