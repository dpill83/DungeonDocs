# Orzhov Representative

*Source: Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica (Legacy).*

The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild's endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov - and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position.
Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value.
