Suggested Characteristics Being a merchant involved having a head for numbers<br>a strong personality. the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries<br>a strong sword arm to fight off bandits<br>and the intuition for knowing what people want<br>need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit<br>and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind<br>a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail? Failed Merchant Personality Trait d8 Personality Trait 1 I didn't have the cutthroat attitude necessary to succeed. I won't make that mistake again. 2 Even my competitors said I was affable<br>talented. Those traits should serve me well. 3 To prosper<br>you have to be in control. 4 The customer is always right. 5 I was cutting corners<br>breaking deals to maximize profit. That's why I failed. 6 When I get an idea<br>I am single-minded in its execution - even if it's a terrible idea. 7 If I can be everyone's friend<br>I'll always have support. 8 My heart wasn't in being a merchant<br>so I failed. I'm not all that keen on adventuring either<br>but I need the money. Failed Merchant Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Survival. Where there's life<br>there's hope. If I remain alive<br>flexible<br>I can succeed. (Any) 2 Generosity. People helped me when I was down. Now that I'm back on my feet<br>I'll pay it forward. (Good) 3 Excitement. Caution got me nowhere in my previous business. I'm not going to let it hold me back now. (Chaotic) 4 Wealth. With enough coin<br>I can buy comfort<br>power<br>knowledge<br>and even eternal life. Nothing will stand between me<br>money. (Evil) 5 Stability. The mercantile trade was too chaotic for me. I need a nice stable profession<br>like adventuring. (Lawful) 6 Redemption. Too many people consider me a failure. So I need to prove them wrong. (Any) Failed Merchant Bonds d6 Bond 1 My family means everything to me. I failed them before<br>and I must not do so again. 2 My church provides a connection to my god<br>so I must ensure that it is protected<br>funded. 3 My former business partner fell ill<br>and then our business failed. Part of my new venture involves earning enough to take care of their family. 4 If I take care of my possessions<br>they'll take care of me. People come<br>go<br>but a weapon or a wand is something you can always rely on. 5 Although my business failed<br>the people of my community were kind to me. I'll do everything in my power to protect them. 6 I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they're happy<br>they let my debt rest unpaid. Failed Merchant Flaws d6 Flaw 1 Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town? 2 I must have the best of everything. Like<br>right now. 3 You haven't heard of me? I'm sure that's because of your ignorance<br>low breeding. 4 I failed<br>but I'm awesome. So when anyone else is successful<br>it must be because of nepotism<br>dishonesty<br>or dumb luck. 5 I find that most people are trustworthy. Hey<br>where's my belt pouch? 6 Nothing gets between me<br>danger except my fellow adventurers. So I'll be sure to put them there. |
