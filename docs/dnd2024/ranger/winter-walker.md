Withstand the Horrors of Frigid Wastelands
Winter Walkers hone their craft in the bleak and frozen wilds of places like Icewind Dale. These ruthless, rimed Rangers hunt monsters that haunt arctic wastelands, eventually becoming frigid terrors themselves. Winter Walkers are well versed in the phenomena of Icewind Dale, including the latent magic of fallen Netherese cities, endemic monsters like yetis and crag cats, and the rising threat of Underdark invaders. Due to their cold pragmatism, terrifying magic, and mastery of the region, Winter Walkers are regarded with equal parts respect and fear. Ten-Towns citizens say that Winter Walkers’ frequent exposure to malignant entities gives them their fearsome powers. Many Reghed nomads, on the other hand, believe that nature spirits bestow on Winter Walkers a unique curse.

Level 7: Fortifying Soul
Your experience surviving harrowing environments allows you to bolster your allies in addition to yourself. As a Magic action, choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). Each chosen creature regains Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Ranger level and has Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Frightened condition for 1 hour.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 11: Chilling Retribution
When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn. While the target is Stunned, its Speed is reduced to 0 feet.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 15: Frozen Haunt
When you cast
Hunter’s Mark
, you can adopt a ghostly, snowy form. This form lasts until the spell ends, and while you are in this form, you gain the following benefits. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a level 4+ spell slot (no action required).
Frozen Soul.
You have Immunity to Cold damage. When you first adopt this form and at the start of each of your subsequent turns, each creature of your choice in a 15-foot Emanation originating from you takes 2d4 Cold damage.
Partially Incorporeal.
You have Immunity to the Grappled, Prone, and Restrained conditions. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were Difficult Terrain, but you take 1d10 Force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object. If the form ends while you are inside a creature or an object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.
