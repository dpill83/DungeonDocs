You have mastered the art of creating fearsome ambushes, granting you the following benefits.

**Ambusher's Leap.** At the start of your first turn of each combat, your speed increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

**Dreadful Strike.** When you attack a creature and hit it with a weapon, you can deal an extra 2d6 Psychic damage. You can use this benefit only once per turn, you can use it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Initiative Bonus.** When you roll Initiative, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.
