**Guard the Threshold Between Day and Night**

The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day's labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night. Clerics who serve these deities bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

Twilight deities include Boldrei and Dol Arrah (Eberron), Celestian (Greyhawk), Helm, Ilmater, and Selûne (Forgotten Realms), Mishakal (Dragonlance), and Yondalla (Halfling).

## Level 3: Eyes of Night

You can see through the deepest gloom. You have darkvision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

As a Magic action, you can magically share the darkvision of this feature with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). The shared darkvision lasts for 1 hour. Once you share it, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to share it again.

## Level 3: Vigilant Blessing

The night has taught you to be vigilant. As a Magic action, you give one creature you touch (including possibly yourself) Advantage on the next initiative roll the creature makes. This benefit ends immediately after the roll or if you use this feature again.

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Twilight Sanctuary

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to refresh your allies with soothing twilight. A sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are Incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:

- You grant it Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d6 plus your Cleric level.
- You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.

## Level 6: Steps of Night

You can draw on the mystical power of night to rise into the air. As a Bonus Action when you are in dim light or darkness, you can magically give yourself a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Twilight Shroud

The twilight that you summon offers a protective embrace: you and your allies have half cover while in the sphere created by your Twilight Sanctuary.
