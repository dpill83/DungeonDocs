**Wield the Storm and the Sea**

Gods of the Tempest domain govern storms, sea, and sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, earthquakes, and certain gods of violence, strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over others and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. Tempest gods include Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor.

## Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

## Level 3: Wrath of the Storm

When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your Reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
