**Champion the Wild and the Harvest**

Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself—from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, Pan) to friendly deities of springs and groves (Eldath). Many of these gods have clerics who hunt evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

## Level 3: Acolyte of Nature

You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. This cantrip counts as a Cleric cantrip for you and doesn't count against the number of Cleric cantrips you know. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.

## Level 3: Bonus Proficiency

You gain proficiency with heavy armor.

## Level 3: Nature Domain Spells

When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Nature Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3            | Animal Friendship, Speak with Animals, Barkskin, Spike Growth |
| 5            | Plant Growth, Wind Wall                              |

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Charm Animals and Plants

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each Beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.

## Level 6: Dampen Elements

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your Reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.

## Level 17: Master of Nature

While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you can take a Bonus Action on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.
