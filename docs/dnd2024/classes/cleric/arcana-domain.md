**Weave Divine and Arcane Power**

Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon; in other worlds, Hecate, Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas, among others.

## Level 3: Arcane Initiate

You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as Cleric cantrips.

## Level 3: Arcana Domain Spells

When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Arcana Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3            | Detect Magic, Magic Missile, Magic Weapon, Nystul's Magic Aura |
| 5            | Dispel Magic, Magic Circle                           |
| 7            | Arcane Eye, Leomund's Secret Chest                   |
| 9            | Planar Binding, Teleportation Circle                 |

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Arcane Abjuration

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity. One Celestial, Elemental, Fey, or Fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take Reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against this feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the Banishment spell, no Concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below the threshold for your level: 5th—CR 1/2 or lower; 8th—CR 1 or lower; 11th—CR 2 or lower; 14th—CR 3 or lower; 17th—CR 4 or lower.

## Level 6: Spell Breaker

When you restore Hit Points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

## Level 17: Arcane Mastery

You choose four spells from the Wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as Cleric spells for you.
