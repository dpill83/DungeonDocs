**Guard the Line Between Life and Death**

Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse's workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead's rest, is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Their followers seek to put restless spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of dying creatures.

## Level 3: Circle of Mortality

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points with a spell to a creature at 0 Hit Points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. In addition, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.

## Level 3: Eyes of the Grave

As a Magic action, you can open your awareness to magically detect Undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any Undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Grave Domain Spells

When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Grave Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3            | Bane, False Life, Gentle Repose, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5            | Revivify, Vampiric Touch                             |
| 7            | Blight, Death Ward                                   |
| 9            | Antilife Shell, Raise Dead                            |

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Path to the Grave

As a Magic action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.

## Level 6: Sentinel at Death's Door

As a Reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Keeper of Souls

When an enemy you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet of you regains Hit Points equal to the enemy's number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren't Incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.
