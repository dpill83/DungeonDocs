**Transform Metal and Craft Divine Arms**

The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty artisan whose works have felled demon lords. They teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed into a beautifully wrought object. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

## Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with heavy armor and Smith's Tools.

## Level 3: Blessing of the Forge

At the end of a Long Rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next Long Rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Forge Domain Spells

When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Forge Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Artisan's Blessing

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you. The item can be worth no more than 100 GP. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal (which can include coins) with a value equal to the creation; the metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's end. The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

## Level 6: Soul of the Forge

You gain resistance to Fire damage. While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

## Level 17: Saint of Forge and Fire

You gain immunity to Fire damage. While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
