**Uphold Law and Discipline**

The Order Domain represents discipline and devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods. They believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Order deities include Aureon (Eberron), Bane and Tyr (Forgotten Realms), Majere (Dragonlance), Pholtus and Wee Jas (Greyhawk).

## Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with heavy armor and in the Intimidation or Persuasion skill (your choice).

## Level 3: Voice of Authority

If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their Reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see. If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

## Level 3: Order Domain Spells

When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Order Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Order's Demand

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol. Each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

## Level 6: Embodiment of the Law

If you cast a spell of the Enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to 1 Bonus Action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Order's Wrath

If you deal your Divine Strike damage (from Blessed Strikes) to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.
