**Channel the Forces of Death and Undeath**

The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death and the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, Pyremius), pain (Loviatar), disease or poison (Talona, Morgion), and the underworld (Hades, Hel).

## Level 3: Reaper

You learn one Necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a Necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Touch of Death

When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal extra Necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice your Cleric level.

## Level 6: Inescapable Destruction

Necrotic damage dealt by your Cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to Necrotic damage.

## Level 17: Improved Reaper

When you cast a Necromancy spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its Material components, you must provide them for each target.
