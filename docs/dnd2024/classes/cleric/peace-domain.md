**Foster Bonds and Resolve Conflict**

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people to resolve conflict and to stand against forces that prevent peace from flourishing. Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties and arbitrate disputes. Peace deities include Angharradh (Elven), Berronar Truesilver (Dwarven), Boldrei (Eberron), Cyrrollalee (Halfling), Eldath (Forgotten Realms), Gaerdal Ironhand (Gnomish), Paladine (Dragonlance), and Rao (Greyhawk).

## Level 3: Implement of Peace

You gain proficiency in the Insight, Performance, or Persuasion skill (your choice).

## Level 3: Emboldening Bond

As a Magic action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Peace Domain Spells

When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Peace Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3            | Heroism, Sanctuary, Aid, Warding Bond                |
| 5            | Beacon of Hope, Sending                              |

| 9            | Greater Restoration, Rary's Telepathic Bond           |

## Level 3: Channel Divinity — Balm of Peace

As a Magic action, you can move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. When you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of Hit Points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

## Level 6: Protective Bond

When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond is about to take damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its Reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.

## Level 17: Expansive Bond

The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond now work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. When a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else's damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.
