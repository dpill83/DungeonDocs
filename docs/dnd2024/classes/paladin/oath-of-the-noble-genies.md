**Brandish the Elemental Splendor of Genies**

Paladins sworn to the Oath of the Noble Genies revere the forces of the Elemental Planes. Through taking this oath, Paladins draw power from the four different types of genies—dao, masters of earth; djinn, masters of air; efreet, masters of fire; and marids, masters of water. In Faerûn, many Paladins who swear this oath hail from Calimshan, a land teeming with genies.

Paladins who swear this oath often undertake quests that take them all over the Realms and across the multiverse—including the Elemental Planes. These paladins share the following tenets:  
Sow the seeds of creation amid the ashes of destruction.  
Lead with splendor and grace.  
Respect the elements, and fear their wrath.

## Level 3: Elemental Smite

Immediately after you cast Divine Smite, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and invoke one of the following effects.

**Dao’s Crush.**  
Earth rises up around the target of your Divine Smite. The target has the Grappled condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While Grappled, the target has the Restrained condition.

**Djinni’s Escape.**  
You teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself and take on a semi-incorporeal form, which lasts until the end of your next turn. While in this form, you have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage, and you have Immunity to the Grappled, Prone, and Restrained conditions.

**Efreeti’s Fury.**  
The target of your Divine Smite takes an extra 2d4 Fire damage, and fire jumps from the target to another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The second creature also takes 2d4 Fire damage.

**Marid’s Surge.**  
The target of your Divine Smite and each creature of your choice in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 15 feet straight away from you and has the Prone condition.

## Level 3: Genie Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Genie Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

When you are hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against yourself (round down) and force the attacker to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes damage equal to 2d10 plus your Charisma modifier of one of the following types (your choice): Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. On a successful save, the attacker takes half as much damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Minor Wish.** When you or an ally in your Aura of Protection fails a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to make you or that ally succeed instead.
