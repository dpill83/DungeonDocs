**Use Magic Device**  
You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits.

### Attunement
You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

### Charges
Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

### Scrolls
You can use any Spell Scroll, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

**Thief's Reflexes**  
You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal Initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.
