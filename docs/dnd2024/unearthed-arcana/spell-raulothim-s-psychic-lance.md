# Spell Raulothim S Psychic Lance

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You unleash a shimmering lance of psychic power from your forehead at a creature that you can see within range. Alternatively, you can utter a creature’s name (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell’s target even if you can’t see it. If the named target isn’t within range or you use an invalid name, the lance dissipates without effect.
The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 Psychic damage and has the Incapacitated condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.
The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 4.
