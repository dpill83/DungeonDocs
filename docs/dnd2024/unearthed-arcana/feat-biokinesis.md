Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Can’t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)
You gain the following benefits.
Bend Life Energy.
When a spell you cast restores Hit Points to a creature, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the total Hit Points restored. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Psionic Talent.
You know the
Spare the Dying
cantrip. You also always have the
Healing Word
spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. When you cast these spells, they require no Verbal or Material components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them (choose when you select this feat).
When you reach character level 3, you also always have the
Arcane Vigor
spell prepared and can cast it the same way.
