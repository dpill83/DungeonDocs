# Spell Summon Astral Entity

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You call forth the spirit of a psionic entity. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the
Psionic Spirit
stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Crystal Entity, Ectoplasmic Entity, or Ghostly Entity. The creature resembles an astral entity of that kind, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.
The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.
Use the spell slot’s level for the spell’s level in the stat block.
