# Subclass Artificer Reanimator

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Reassemble Corpses to Raise the Dead
Reanimators defy the laws of nature in pursuit of gruesome experiment. These grim Artificers stitch together servants from disparate corpses, use foul magic to strengthen the living, and transform the art of necromancy into a terrifying science.

Level 3: Jolt to Life
When you cast
Spare the Dying
, you can modify the spell so that it sends a jolt of electricity through the target, reviving it. The target regains 1 Hit Point, and each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from the target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creatures take Lightning damage equal to 1d4 plus half your Artificer level (round up). On a successful save, they take half as much damage.
You can modify the spell this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Reanimated Companion
Using Tinker’s Tools or another type of Artisan’s Tools with which you have proficiency, you can take a Magic action to create a Reanimated Companion (see the stat block) through the power of necromancy and science. The companion manifests in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You determine the companion’s appearance; your choices don’t affect the companion’s game statistics.
The companion is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys you. It lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you take a Magic action to dismiss it early, at which point it harmlessly collapses into a pile of viscera. It immediately drops to 0 Hit Points and dies (triggering its Death Burst trait) if you die.
Once you create a companion, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest or expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one companion at a time and can’t create one while your companion is present.
The Companion in Combat
In combat, the companion acts during your turn. It can move and take its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the companion acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.
