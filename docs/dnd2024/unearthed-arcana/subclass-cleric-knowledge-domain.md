# Subclass Cleric Knowledge Domain

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Unearth Secrets and Master the Mind
The Knowledge Domain values learning and understanding above all. Clerics who tap into this domain study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and examine the process of the mind itself.
Gods of knowledge vary from masters of arcane magic to patrons of craft and invention. To them, knowledge is more valuable than material wealth, and the desire to learn is an act of worship. Libraries, universities, and other institutions dedicated to education also draw on the power of the Knowledge Domain.
On Faerûn, Clerics of the Knowledge Domain worship deities of learning and ingenuity like Oghma and Gond. Other powerful deities - such as Asmodeus, Mystra, Savras, and Jergal - also count Clerics of the Knowledge Domain among their devotees, as do less-common divinities like Deneir, the Scribe of Oghma, and Azuth, servant of Mystra.

Level 3: Mind Magic
As a Magic action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to manifest your magical knowledge. Choose one spell from the Knowledge Domain Spells table that you have prepared. As part of that action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components.
Level 6: Unfettered Mind
You gain telepathy out to 60 feet. When you use this telepathy, you can simultaneously contact a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one).
Additionally, if your total for an Intelligence check is lower than your Wisdom score, you can use that score in place of the total.
Level 17: Divine Foreknowledge
As a Bonus Action, you magically expand your mind to the possibilities of the future. For 1 hour, you have Advantage on D20 Tests. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of this feature by expending a level 6+ spell slot (no action required).
