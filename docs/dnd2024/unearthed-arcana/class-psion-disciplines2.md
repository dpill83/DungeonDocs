Psionic Discipline options appear in alphabetical order.
Biofeedback
When you cast a Psion spell from the Necromancy or Transmutation school, you can expend a number of Psionic Energy Dice up to your Intelligence modifier, roll them, and gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the total number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
Bolstering Precognition
When you cast a Psion spell from the Abjuration or Divination school, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die. Roll the die and choose a creature you can see within 60 feet (which can be yourself). Until the end of your next turn, the creature gains a bonus to the next D20 Test it makes equal to the number rolled.
Destructive Thoughts
When you cast a Psion spell from the Conjuration or Evocation school that forces a creature you can see to make a saving throw against the spell, you can expend a number of Psionic Energy Dice up to your Intelligence modifier, and roll them. The creature takes Psychic damage equal to the total number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), regardless of the result of the saving throw.
Devilish Tongue
When you take the Influence action, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the ability check. If this causes you to succeed on the ability check, the die is expended.
Expanded Awareness
When you take the Search action, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the ability check. If this causes you to succeed on the ability check, the die is expended.
Id Insinuation
When you cast a Psion spell from the Enchantment or Illusion school that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can expend one Psionic Energy Dice and roll it. One target of the spell you can see subtracts half the number rolled (round up) from its saving throw against the spell.
Inerrant Aim
When you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll, potentially turning the miss into a hit. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.
Observant Mind
When you take the Study action, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the ability check. If this causes you to succeed on the ability check, the die is expended.
Psionic Backlash
Immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and reduce the damage you take from the attack equal to two times the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of two). In addition, you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes Psychic damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced.
Psionic Guards
At the start of your turn, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die. Until the start of your next turn, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Advantage on Intelligence saving throws. If you are Charmed or Frightened when you use this discipline, the condition ends on you.
When you use Psionic Guards, you can also use a different Psionic Discipline this turn.
Sharpened Mind
At the start of your turn, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to hone your destructive psionics. Roll the die and record the number rolled. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition.
Bypassing Psionics.
Damage from your weapon attacks, Psion spells, and Psion features ignores Resistance to Psychic damage.
Attack Mode.
Once per turn, when you deal Psychic damage to one or more creatures, you can replace the number rolled on one of the damage dice with the number recorded when you activated this Psionic Discipline.
When you use Sharpened Mind, you can also use a different Psionic Discipline this turn.
