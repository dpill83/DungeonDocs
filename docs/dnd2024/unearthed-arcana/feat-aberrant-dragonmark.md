Dragonmark Feat (Prerequisite: Eberron Campaign, Can’t have another Dragonmark Feat)
You gain the following benefits.
Aberrant Fortitude.
When you make a Constitution saving throw, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the save. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish
a Long Rest.
Aberrant Magic.
You know one cantrip of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list. Also, choose a level 1 spell from that spell list. You always have that
spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
Aberrant Surge.
When you cast the level 1 spell from this feat, you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice and roll it. If you roll an even number, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the number rolled. If you roll an odd number, one
creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes Force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.
