<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Transform Energy and Matter
You study spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.
Some Transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.
Level 3: Transmutation Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Transmutation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Transmutation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Transmuter's Stone
When you finish a Long Rest, you can create a magic pebble called a transmuter’s stone that lasts until you use this feature again. A creature with the stone in its possession gains a benefit from one of the following options, which you choose when you create the stone. You can change the stone’s benefit when you cast a Transmutation spell using a spell slot.
Darkvision.
The bearer gains Darkvision with a range of 60 feet or increases the range of its Darkvision by 60 feet.
Speed.
The bearer’s Speed increases by 10 feet.
Durability.
The bearer gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws.
Resistance.
The bearer gains Resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder damage (your choice each time you choose this benefit).
Level 3: Wondrous Enhancement
You always have
Enhance Ability
prepared and can cast it once without a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a Long Rest.
Targets of your
Enhance Ability
also have Advantage on saving throws using the chosen ability.
Level 6: Split Transmutation
When you cast a Transmutation spell, such as
Fly
, that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, increase the spell’s effective level by 1.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Potent Stone
Your transmuter’s stone is more versatile. You choose up to two options when you create your transmuter’s stone. You can choose each option other than Resistance only once. If you choose Resistance twice, you must choose different damage types. You can change either or both benefits when you cast a Transmutation spell using a spell slot.
Level 14: Master Transmuter
As a Magic action, you can consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored in your transmuter’s stone to choose one of the following benefits. After using your transmuter’s stone in this way, it crumbles to dust.
Panacea.
The bearer regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice your Wizard level and ends a curse, including the target’s Attunement to a cursed item.
Restore Life.
You cast
Raise Dead
without a spell slot, using the stone in place of the normally required Material components.
Restore Youth.
The bearer permanently appears 3d10 years younger, to a minimum of young adulthood.
