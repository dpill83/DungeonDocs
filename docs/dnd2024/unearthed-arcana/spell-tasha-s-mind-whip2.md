You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 Psychic damage and can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the end of its next turn. On its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a Bonus Action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.
You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
