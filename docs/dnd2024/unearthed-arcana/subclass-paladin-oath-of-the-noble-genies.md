# Subclass Paladin Oath Of The Noble Genies

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Brandish the Elemental Splendor of Genies
Paladins sworn to the Oath of the Noble Genies revere the forces of the Elemental Planes. Through taking this oath, Paladins draw power from the four different types of genies—dao, masters of earth; djinn, masters of air; efreet, masters of fire; and marids, masters of water—to create splendid and destructive displays of elemental might.
On Faerûn, many Paladins who swear this oath hail from Calimshan, a land rife with genie-kind. Despite their strong local ties, these Calishite Paladins often undertake quests that take them all over the Realms and across the multiverse—including, naturally, the Elemental Planes.
These paladins share the following tenets:
Beget creation with destruction.
Lead with splendor and grace.
Respect the elements, and fear their wrath.
Level 3: Elemental Smite
Immediately after you cast Divine Smite, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and invoke one of the following effects.
Dao’s Crush.
The target has the Grappled condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While Grappled, the target has the Restrained condition.
Djinni’s Escape.
You teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself and take on a mist-like form, which lasts until the end of your next turn. While in this form, you have Immunity to the Grappled, Prone, and Restrained conditions.
Efreeti’s Fury.
The target takes an extra 2d4 Fire damage.
Marid’s Surge.
The target and each creature of your choice in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you makes a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 15 feet straight away from you and has the Prone condition.
Level 3: Genie Spells
When you reach a Paladin level specified in the Genie Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Genie's Splendor
When you aren’t wearing Medium or Heavy armor, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.
Level 7: Aura of Elemental Shielding
Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage. You and your allies have Resistance to that damage type while in your Aura of Protection.
At the start of each of your turns, you can change the damage type affected by this feature to one of the other listed options (no action required).
Level 15: Elemental Rebuke
When you are hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against yourself (round down) and force the attacker to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes damage equal to 4d10 plus your Charisma modifier; the damage is one of the following types (your choice): Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. On a successful save, the attacker takes half as much damage.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 20: Noble Scion
As a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).
Flight.
You have a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover.
Minor Wish.
When you or an ally in your Aura of Protection fails a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to make the D20 Test succeed instead.
