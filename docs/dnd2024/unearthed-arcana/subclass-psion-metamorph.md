Level 3: Organic Weapons
You can shape your limbs into weapons. Whenever you take the Attack action or make an Opportunity Attack, you can reform your free hand into one of the following organic weapons: Bone Blade, Flesh Maul, or Viscera Launcher. Your limb immediately returns to its previous form after your Organic Weapon hits or misses its target.
Whenever you attack with the weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Psychic damage or its normal damage type.
Bone Blade.
A blade made of bone springs from your forearm or extends from your hand. The blade counts as a Simple Melee weapon with the Finesse property, and it deals 1d8 Piercing damage on a hit. You have Advantage on the attack roll you make with the blade if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition.

Your fist and forearm coalesce into a hardened mass of flesh and bone. The maul counts as a Simple Melee weapon and deals 1d10 Bludgeoning damage on a hit. A creature hit by the maul has Disadvantage on the next Strength or Constitution saving throw it makes before the start of its next turn.
Viscera Launcher.
Your hand and forearm transform into a crossbow made of muscle and sinew that fires bolts of bile. The launcher counts as a Simple Ranged weapon with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet, and it deals 1d6 Acid damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using the launcher, you can deal an extra 1d6 Acid damage to the target.

In addition, you can cast one of your Psion cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

While you aren’t wearing armor, you can take the Dash action as a Bonus Action and you have a Climb Speed and Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

Additionally, one creature of your choice in that area takes Necrotic damage equal to the number rolled.
