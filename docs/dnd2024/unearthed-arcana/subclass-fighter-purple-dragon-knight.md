# Subclass Fighter Purple Dragon Knight

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Herald the Majesty of Amethyst Dragons
The Purple Dragon Knights are paragons of valor and leadership who partner with amethyst dragons. Such knights aspire to protect the innocent and rally fellow adventurers to the causes of justice and freedom. Although the Purple Dragons were originally founded in Cormyr, new recruits are enlisted from any realms where chivalry is in abundance, including the Silver Marches, Damara, and Chessenta.
Characters with this subclass are special among the order. Unlike most Purple Dragons, who partner with amethyst dragons who’ve already reached adulthood, a Purple Dragon Knight character psionically bonds with an amethyst dragon hatchling. This bond irrevocably transforms both dragon and knight, allowing the dragon to grow in strength alongside its partner knight.
Level 3: Knightly Envoy
You learn one language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in the Player’s Handbook.
Additionally, you can cast the

spell but only as a Ritual. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
Level 3: Purple Dragon Companion
You are bonded with an amethyst dragon hatchling that serves as your purple dragon companion and uses the
Purple Dragon Companion
stat block. The purple dragon is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands.
The Dragon in Combat.
In combat, the dragon acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the dragon acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.
Resurrecting the Dragon.
If the dragon companion has died within the last hour, you can take a Magic action to touch the dragon and expend a use of your Second Wind. The dragon returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.
Otherwise, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to resurrect the dragon; this ceremony can be performed as part of a Short or Long Rest.

It takes you only 5 feet of movement to mount or dismount the dragon.
