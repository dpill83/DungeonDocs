# Spell Enemies Abound

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or have the Frightened condition for the duration.
While Frightened, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe and is affected in the following ways:
• The target regards all creatures it can see as enemies.
• Whenever the target chooses a creature other than itself for an attack, spell, or other ability, it must choose at random from among the creatures it can see within range of that attack, spell, or other ability.
• The target must make an Opportunity Attack each time it is able to.
Each time the target takes damage, it makes another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.
