# Subclass Warlock Undead Patron

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You’ve made a pact with a creature that defies the cycle of life and death: a powerful lich, vampire, or other entity of undeath. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient patrons know firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will among the living.
Level 3: Form of Dread
As a Bonus Action, you transform into an avatar of your patron’s dreadful power, gaining the benefits below for 1 minute, until you have the Incapacitated condition, or until you end the form (no action required). You can transform a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Facsimile of Life.
You gain Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Warlock level.
Frightful Avatar.
You have Immunity to the Frightened condition. Additionally, once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.
Level 3: Undead Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Undead Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 6: Grave Touched
Your patron’s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic, granting you the following benefits.
Arcane Necrosis.
Whenever you cast a spell or hit a creature with an attack roll and deal Necrotic damage, the damage dealt ignores Resistance to Necrotic damage.
Additionally, once per turn when you cast a spell that deals damage while using your Form of Dread, you can change that spell’s damage type to Necrotic.
Undead Endurance.
You don’t gain Exhaustion levels from dehydration, malnutrition, or suffocation. In addition, you don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Level 10: Necrotic Husk
Your connection to undeath now saturates your body. You gain the following benefits:
Necrotic Resilience.
You have Resistance to Necrotic damage. While using your Form of Dread, you have Immunity to Necrotic damage.
Unholy Resuscitation.
If you drop to 0 Hit Points and don’t die outright, you can cause your body to erupt with deathly energy. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking Necrotic damage equal to 2d10 plus your Warlock level on a failure or half as much damage on a success. Your Hit Points then change to 10 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 10 Hit Points), and you gain 1 level of Exhaustion.
Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
Level 14: Superior Dread
Your Form of Dread improves, granting you the following benefits while you are using it:
Flight.
You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover.
Profane Casting.
Whenever you cast a Warlock spell from the Conjuration or Necromancy school, you cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.
Vitality Siphon.
Once per turn, when you deal Necrotic damage to a creature, you regain Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).
