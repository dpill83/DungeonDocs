When you cast
Magic Weapon
, you can modify the spell so that the first time you attack with the weapon on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. For example, if the bonus is +2, you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. The adjusted bonus remains in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it. Once you modify the spell using this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
