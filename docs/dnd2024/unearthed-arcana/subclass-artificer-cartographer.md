Level 3: Adventurers Atlas.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest while holding Cartographer’s Tools, you can use that tool to create a set of magical maps by touching at least two creatures (one of whom can be yourself), up to a maximum number of creatures equal to 1 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of two creatures).
Each target receives a magical map, which is illegible to all others. The maps last until you die or until you use this feature again, at which point any existing
maps created by this feature immediately vanish.
While carrying the map, a target gains the following benefits.
Awareness.
The target adds 1d4 to its Initiative rolls.
Positioning.
The target knows the location of all other map holders that are on the same plane of existence as itself. When casting a spell or creating an effect that requires being able to see the target, a map holder can target another map holder regardless of sight, so long as the other map holder is still within the spell or effect’s range.
Level 3: Scouting Gadgets.
You gain the following benefits.
Boost.
On your turn, you can expend half your movement to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of yourself. You can’t use this benefit if your Speed is 0.
Radar.
You can cast
Faerie Fire
without expending
a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 5: Portal Jump.
As a Bonus Action, you teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
You can also use this ability without expending a use if the destination space is within 5 feet of a creature carrying a map created with your Adventurer’s Atlas. Doing so destroys the map that creature carries.
Level 9: Ingenious Movement.
When you use your Flash of Genius, you or a willing creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet of yourself can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see as part of that same Reaction.
Level 15: Superior Atlas.
Your Adventurer’s Atlas improves, gaining the following benefits.
Safe Haven.
When a map holder is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, that creature can destroy its map. The creature is then teleported to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or another map holder of its choice and is Stable.
Unerring Path.
If you are one of the map holders for your Adventurer’s Atlas, you can cast
Find the Path
without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without needing spell components. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
Unshakeable Mind.
While at least one map created with your Adventurer’s Atlas still exists, taking damage can’t cause you to lose Concentration on your Artificer spells.
