# Subclass Sorcerer Shadow Sorcery

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Bend Darkness and Doom to Your Will
Your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to the Shadowfell’s sinister energy and were transformed by it.
Your shadowy magic allows you to command darkness, undeath, and woe with ease.
Level 3: Eyes of the Dark
You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet and Blindsight with a range of 10 feet.
In addition, if a spell you cast creates an area of Darkness, you can see normally through that spell’s Darkness.
Level 3: Shadow Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Shadow Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 6: Spirits of Ill Omen
You can cast
Summon Undead
without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and the spell ends early if you cast it again.
Level 14: Shadow Walk
While you are in Dim Light or Darkness, you can take a Bonus Action to teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in Dim Light or Darkness.
Level 18: Umbral Form
As a Bonus Action, you adopt a shadowy form, gaining the benefits below for 1 minute, until you have the Incapacitated condition, or until you end the form (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 6 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.
Incorporeal Movement.
You can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you take 1d10 Force damage.
Shadow Resilience.
You have Resistance to all damage except Force and Radiant damage.
Strength of the Grave.
If you would drop to 0 Hit Points and not die outright, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 plus half the damage taken). If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to three times your Sorcerer level.
