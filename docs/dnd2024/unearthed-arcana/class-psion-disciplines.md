<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Psionic Discipline options appear in alphabetical order.
Biofeedback
When you cast a Psion spell from the Necromancy or Transmutation school, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it. You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
Destructive Thoughts
When you cast a Psion spell from the Conjuration or Evocation school and a creature you can see succeeds on a saving throw against the spell, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it. The creature takes Psychic damage equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
Devilish Tongue
When you take the Influence action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the ability check.
Ego Whip
When a creature provokes an Opportunity Attack from you by leaving your reach, you can take a Reaction to roll one Psionic Energy Die and force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s Speed is reduced by 10 feet and it subtracts the number rolled from the next damage roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
The die is expended only if the target fails the saving throw.
Expanded Awareness
When you take the Search action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the ability check.
Id Insinuation
When you cast a Psion spell from the Enchantment or Illusion school that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can expend two Psionic Energy Dice and roll one Psionic Energy Die. One target of the spell you can see subtracts the number rolled from its saving throw against the spell.
Inerrant Aim
When you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll, potentially turning the miss into a hit. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.
Psionic Backlash
Immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll two Psionic Energy Dice, and subtract the number rolled on each die from the total. In addition, you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes Psychic damage equal to the amount rolled on the two Psionic Energy Dice.
Psionic Guards
At the start of your turn, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die. Until the start of your next turn, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Advantage on Intelligence saving throws. If you are Charmed or Frightened when you use this discipline, the condition ends on you.
When you use Psionic Guards, you can also use a different Psionic Discipline this turn.
Swift Precognition
When you cast a Psion spell from the Abjuration or Divination school with a casting time of an action, you can expend a number of Psionic Energy Dice to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. The number of dice equals one plus the spell’s level.
Tactical Mind
When you take the Study action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the ability check.
