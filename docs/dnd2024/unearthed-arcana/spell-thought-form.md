<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You briefly transform into a psionic spirit. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends.
Ghostly Form.
You have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and you have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.
Incorporeal Movement.
You have a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover. You can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you take 1d10 Force damage. If the spell ends in such a space, you are returned to the last unoccupied space you were in.
Psionic Recharge.
As a Magic action, you can touch a creature (which can be yourself) and roll 1d6. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals half the number rolled (round up) or lower. Once a creature regains a spell slot from this spell, that creature can’t do so again until it finishes a Long Rest.
