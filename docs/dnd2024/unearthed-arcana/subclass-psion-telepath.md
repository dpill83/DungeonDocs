# Subclass Psion Telepath

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Master Tactics in the Landscape of the Mind
Telepaths are masters of mind magic. They use their psionic powers for all matters of the mind, whether they bolster the mental defenses of allies or probe the thoughts of others undetected. A telepath can be a bastion of psionic aid or a crafty manipulator.

Level 3: Mind Infiltrator
When you cast
Detect Thoughts
, you can expend two Psionic Energy Dice to modify the spell so that the spell doesn’t require spell components or Concentration, and the target does not know you’re probing its mind if it fails the Wisdom saving throw.
Level 3: Telepathic Hub
You have telepathy with a range of 10 feet. When you expend a Psionic Energy Die as part of using Telepathic Connection to increase the range of your telepathy, for the duration of the effect, you can simultaneously contact a number of creatures equal to 1 plus the number rolled on the Psionic Energy Die.
Level 6: Empowered Defense Mode
While your Defense Mode is active, whenever you make a saving throw, you add 1d4 to the save.
In addition, while your Defense mode is active, you can extend this benefit to creatures you are telepathically connected with using your Telepathic Connection.
Level 6: Potent Thoughts
You add your Intelligence modifier to the damage you deal with any Psion cantrip.
Level 10: Telepathic Bolstering
You have telepathy out to 30 feet. When you or a creature you can see within range of your telepathy fails an ability check or misses with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll the die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failed check into a success or a miss into a hit. The Psionic Energy Die is expended only if the check succeeds or the attack hits.
Level 14: Scramble Minds
When you cast
Confusion
, you can expend four Psionic Energy Dice to modify the spell so that the radius of the spell’s Sphere becomes 30 feet.
In addition, creatures under the effect of the spell roll two d10s, and you choose which roll determines their behavior on their turns.
