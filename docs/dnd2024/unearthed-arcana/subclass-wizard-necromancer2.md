# Subclass Wizard Necromancer2

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Command the Powers of Death and Undeath
You explore the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As a Necromancer, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all creatures. As you progress, you learn to use magic to drain the life force from a creature and transform its vital energy into magical power.
Many see Necromancers as menacing or villainous, though not all Necromancers are evil. Nevertheless, the manipulation of life and death is considered taboo in many societies.
Level 3: Necromancy Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Necromancy school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Necromancy school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Necromancy Spellbook
The necromantic secrets in your spellbook grant you additional powers. You gain the following benefits.
Necrotic Resistance. You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.
Grim Harvest.
When you cast a Necromancy spell using a spell slot, you can choose an Undead creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to regain a number of Hit Points equal to the level of the spell slot expended plus your Wizard level.
Undead Familiar.
The
Find Familiar
spell appears in your spellbook. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Skeleton or Zombie (see appendix B of the Player’s Handbook for the familiar’s stat block).
Level 6: Grave Power
You have discovered more necromantic insights and inscribed them in your spellbook. While holding your spellbook, you gain the following benefits.
Grave Resilience.
When you use Arcane Recovery, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.
Overwhelming Necrosis.
Damage from your Wizard spells and Wizard features ignores Resistance to Necrotic damage.
Level 6: Undead Thralls
You always have
Animate Dead
prepared and can cast it once without expending a spell slot.
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that the spell’s effective level is increased by 1.
In addition, whenever you cast a Necromancy spell using a spell slot that creates or summons an Undead, the Undead gains the benefits below.
Undead Fortitude.
The Undead’s Hit Point maximum and current Hit points increase by a number equal to the level of the spell slot used plus your Intelligence modifier for the duration of the spell.
Withering Strike.
Whenever the Undead hits a creature with an attack roll, the Undead deals extra Necrotic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Necrotic damage).
Level 10: Harvest Undead
You have learned more secrets about the nuances of life and death. Immediately after you become Bloodied but aren’t killed outright from taking damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce an Undead creature under your control that you can see to 0 Hit Points. You then immediately regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Wizard level.
Level 14 Death's Master
Abstruse rituals within your spellbook allow you mastery over forces of death. While holding your spellbook, you gain the following benefits.
Bolster Undead.
As a Bonus Action, choose any number of Undead you have created or summoned with a Necromancy spell that are within 60 feet of you. Those Undead each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Wizard level.
Once an Undead gains Temporary Hit Points from this feature, it can’t gain them in this way again for the next 24 hours.
Extinguish Undead.
When an Undead creature you can see is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can cause it to explode with necrotic energy. Roll a number of d6s equal to half the creature’s unexpended Hit Dice (round up, minimum of 1d6) and add them together. Each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from the Undead makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes Necrotic damage equal to the number rolled and can’t take Reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only. When you use this feature to explode an Undead creature you don’t control, you must take a Reaction and expend a level 5+ spell slot to do so.
