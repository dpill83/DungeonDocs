# Subclass Fighter Arcane Archer

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. The first Arcane Archers stood watch over their communities, keeping a keen eye out for dangers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders. Over the centuries, other species have learned the elves’ mystical methods of blending arcane aptitude with archery and broadened their application to ranged weapons of many kinds while applying those talents to an adventuring life.
Level 3: Arcane Archer Lore
You learn magical theory and secrets of nature, granting you the following benefits.
Cantrip.
You know either the
Druidcraft
or
Prestidigitation
cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
Skills.
You gain proficiency in the Arcana and Nature skills. If you already have one of these proficiencies, you instead gain proficiency in a different skill of your choice (or with two other skills if you have both).
Level 3: Arcane Shot
You learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots.
Arcane Shot Options.
You learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice from the “Arcane Shot Options” section later in this subclass’s description.
You learn an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach Fighter levels 7, 10, 15, and 18. Each time you learn a new Arcane Shot option, you can also replace one option you know with a different one.
Using Arcane Shot.
Once per turn when you make a ranged attack using a weapon with the Ammunition property, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that attack. You decide to use the option when you hit a creature and deal damage to it unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
Arcane Shot Die.
Arcane Shot options refer to your Arcane Shot Die. Your Arcane Shot Die is a d6.
Saving Throws.
If an Arcane Shot option requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Intelligence modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus.
Level 7: Curving Shot
You learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. If you make an attack roll with a weapon with the Ammunition property and miss, as a Bonus Action immediately after the attack, you can make an extra attack with the same weapon against a different target that you can see, that is within the weapon’s long range, and that isn’t behind Total Cover. This extra attack doesn’t require ammunition.
Level 7: Ever Ready Shot
When you roll Initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot left, you regain one expended use of it.
Level 10: Improved Shots
Your Arcane Shot Die becomes a d8.
Level 15: Powerful Shots
Your Arcane Shot Die becomes a d10.
Level 18: Masterful Shots
Your Arcane Shot Die becomes a d12.
Arcane Shot Options
The Arcane Shot options are presented here in
alphabetical order.
Banishing Shot.
Your magic temporarily sequesters your target in a harmless demiplane. The creature you hit takes additional Psychic damage equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die and must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished, the creature has the Incapacitated condition and a Speed of 0. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
Beguiling Shot.
Your magic causes the ammunition to temporarily beguile your target. The creature you hit takes additional Psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the start of your next turn, treating either you or one of your allies within 30 feet of the target (your choice) as the charmer. The Charmed condition ends early if the charmer attacks the target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw. Bursting Shot. You imbue your ammunition with explosive force energy. Immediately after you deal damage to the creature, your target and each creature within a 10-foot Emanation originating from the target takes Force damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die.
Enfeebling Shot.
Your ammunition saps your target’s strength. The creature you hit takes additional Necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the end of its next turn. Whenever a target Poisoned in this way hits with an attack roll, it subtracts an amount equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die from the total damage of that attack.
Grasping Shot.
Your ammunition creates clutching brambles around your target. The creature you hit takes additional Slashing damage equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition until the start of your next turn. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot DC, removing the brambles and ending the Restrained condition on the target on a successful check.
Piercing Shot.
You give your ammunition an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the ammunition shoots forward in a 30-foot Line that is 1 foot wide, originating from you, then vanishes. The Line ignores cover, as the ammunition phases through solid objects. Each creature in the Line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit plus additional Piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
Seeking Shot.
You grant your ammunition the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the last minute. The ammunition flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring Half Cover and Three Quarters Cover. If the target is within your weapon’s long range, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the ammunition disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit plus additional Force damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
Shadow Shot.
Your magic occludes your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature you hit takes additional Psychic damage equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.
