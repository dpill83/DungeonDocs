<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


A Battle Smith is a combination of protector and medic, an expert at defending others and repairing both materiel and personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are accompanied by a Steel Defender, a protective companion of their own creation.
Level 3: Tool Proficiency
You gain proficiency with Smith’s Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.
In addition, when you craft an ordinary or magic weapon, the amount of time required to craft it is halved.

Level 3: Battle Ready
Your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:
Arcane Empowerment.
When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.
Weapon Knowledge.
You gain proficiency with Martial weapons.
Level 3: Steel Defender
Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a Steel Defender (see the stat block). You determine the defender’s appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choices don’t affect the defender’s game statistics.
The Steel Defender is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys you. It vanishes if you die.
The Defender in Combat.
In combat, the defender acts during your turn. It can move and take its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the defender acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.
Restoring or Replacing the Defender.
If the defender has died within the last hour, you can take a Magic action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can create a new Steel Defender if you have Smith’s Tools in hand. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one vanishes.
