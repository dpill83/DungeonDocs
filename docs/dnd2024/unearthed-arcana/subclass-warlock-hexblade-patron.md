<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You’ve made a pact with a sentient magic weapon and the cursed forces contained within its blade.
Such a weapon could be the sword sheathed at a Warlock’s side, or it could be an infamous magic weapon stored elsewhere, projecting its power across the multiverse to further its cunning plans.
To those who are willing to follow this weapon’s whims, these inscrutable patrons offer the power to bestow malignant curses, deliver punishing blows, and bolster the wielder.
Level 3: Hexblade Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Hexblade Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Your patron grants you the power to summon cursed echoes of its blade to hinder your foes. You gain the following benefits:
Hexblade’s Curse.
You can cast
Hex

Once per turn, when you hit a target cursed by your

The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target can’t make Opportunity Attacks and its Speed is halved until the start of your next turn.
Harrowing Blade.
The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the next time the target makes an attack roll against a creature other than you before the start of your next turn, the target takes Necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Stymying Mark.
The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
Level 6: Life Stealer

Whenever the target cursed by your
Hex
drops to 0 Hit Points, you regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Charisma modifier.
Inevitable Blade.
Once per turn, if you make an attack roll against the target cursed by your
Hex
and miss, you can deal Necrotic damage to that creature equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 Necrotic damage).
Level 10: Armor of Hexes
When you take damage from the cursed target of your
Hex
, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to 2d8 plus your Charisma modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 14: Masterful Hex
Your patron’s accursed might flows even more strongly through you, granting the following benefits.
Accursed Critical.
Any attack roll you make against the target cursed by your
Hex
scores a Critical Hit on a roll of a 19 or 20 on the d20.
Infectious Hex.
When you use one of your Hexblade’s Maneuvers, you can target one additional creature within 30 feet of the cursed target. The additional target takes 1d6 Necrotic damage.
Resilient Hex.
Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on
Hex
.
