<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Call Forth Spirits from Beyond the Grave
Using occult trappings, Bards of the College of Spirits conjure legendary and long-dead spirits to change the world once more. But such entities are capricious, and what a Bard summons isn’t always entirely under their control.
Level 3: Channeler
You learn how to contact spirits beyond the grave, letting their power and knowledge flow through you. You gain the following benefits:
Guiding Whispers.
You know the
Guidance
cantrip. When you cast it, its range is 60 feet.
Spiritual Focus.
You employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits. You gain a Gaming Set (Playing Cards) and have proficiency with it.
Additionally, you can use the cards or one of the following items as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells: Arcane Focus (Crystal or Orb), Candle or Ink Pen.
Level 3: Spirits From Beyond
While holding a Spellcasting Focus, you can take a Bonus Action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and call forth the powers of a spirit.
Roll your Bardic Inspiration die and consult the Spirits from Beyond table to determine the spirit you channel. Then choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself as the spirit’s target.
The spirit’s effect occurs immediately. If the spirit’s effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals your Bard spell save DC.

spell prepared.
You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you cast
Spirit Guardians

Level 14: Mystical Connection
You gain mastery over the spirits you call forth.
Whenever you roll on the Spirits from Beyond table, you can roll the Bardic Inspiration die twice and choose which of the two effects to bestow.
