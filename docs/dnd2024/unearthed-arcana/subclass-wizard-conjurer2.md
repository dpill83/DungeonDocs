<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Step Across Space and Call Creatures from Thin Air
You consider distance and matter to be flexible guidelines rather than physical laws. Conjurers harness the power of magic that moves creatures instantly through space and summons creatures to fight on their behalf.
Level 3: Benign Transposition
As a Bonus Action, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Medium or smaller creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Conjuration Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Conjuration school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Conjuration school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 6: Distant Transposition
The range of your Benign Transposition feature increases to 60 feet. Additionally, you now regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
Level 6: Durable Summons
When you cast a Conjuration spell to summon or create a creature using a spell slot, that creature gains Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wizard level when it first appears. While it has these Temporary Hit Points, the creature has Resistance to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant.
Level 10: Focused Conjuration
Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on Conjuration spells.
Level 14: Splintered Summons
When you cast
Summon Aberration
,
Summon Construct
,
Summon Dragon
,
Summon Elemental
, or
Summon Fey
using a spell slot, you can modify the spell to summon two creatures with the spell instead of one. Each creature is of the same kind, uses the stat block and rules denoted by the spell, and manifests in a different unoccupied space of your choice within the spell’s range, but the summoned creatures’ Hit Points are halved. If you lose Concentration on the spell, both creatures disappear.
Once you use this feature to modify a spell in this way, you must finish a Long Rest before you do so again. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5+ spell slot (no action required).
