You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 12d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Constructs automatically succeed at the save, and Plant creatures automatically fail the save.
Nonmagical plants in the area that aren’t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
