Entrance and Beguile Others
Your magic clouds or captivates minds. Some Enchanters use their abilities to encourage peace and soften cruelty, while others use their mind altering magic for selfish ends. Many Enchanters fall somewhere in between.
Level 3: Enchanting Conversationalist
You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.
In addition, when you make an ability check with the chosen skill, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
Level 3: Enchantment Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Enchantment school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Enchantment school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Hypnotic Presence
Your charming words and enchanting gaze can enthrall another creature. As a Magic action, choose one creature that you can see within 10 feet of yourself. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have the Charmed condition for 1 minute or until your Concentration ends, the target is more than 10 feet away from you, the target can neither see nor hear you, or the target takes damage. While Charmed in this way, the target has the Incapacitated condition and a Speed of 0.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 1+ spell slot (no action required).
Level 6: Split Enchantment
When you cast an Enchantment spell, such as
Charm Person
, that can be cast with a higher level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can increase the spell’s effective level by 1.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Instinctive Charm
When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.
On a failed save, the attack misses instead, and if there is another creature within range of the attack other than the attacker, the attacker targets that creature with the triggering attack, using the same attack roll. If multiple creatures are within the attack’s range, you choose which one to target.
Once you use this Reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by casting an Enchantment spell with a spell slot.
Level 14: Alter Memories
You can reliably enchant creatures and alter their memories. You always have the
Modify Memory
spell prepared. When you cast the spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within range of the spell.
