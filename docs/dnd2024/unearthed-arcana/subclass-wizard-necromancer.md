# Subclass Wizard Necromancer

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Command the Powers of Death and Undeath
You explore the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As a Necromancer, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all creatures. As you progress, you learn to use magic to drain the life force from a creature, transforming its vital energy into magical power. Many see Necromancers as menacing or villainous, though not all Necromancers are evil.
Nevertheless, the manipulation of life and death is considered taboo in many societies.
Level 3: Necromancy Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Necromancy school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Necromancy school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Necromancy Spellbook
Secrets of necromancy magic in your spellbook grant you additional powers. You gain the following benefits.
Necrotic Resistance.
You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.
Grim Harvest.
When you cast a Necromancy spell using a spell slot, choose yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the level of the spell slot plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 Temporary Hit Point).
Level 6: Grave Power
You have discovered more necromantic insights and inscribed them into your spellbook. While holding your spellbook, you gain the following benefits.
Grave Resilience.
When you use Arcane Recovery, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.
Overwhelming Necrosis.
Damage from your Wizard spells and Wizard features ignores Resistance to Necrotic damage.
Level 6: Undead Thralls
You always have
Summon Undead
prepared and can cast it once without expending a spell slot.
When you cast
Summon Undead
without a spell slot, you can regain Hit Points equal to half the summoned creature’s total Hit Points, but doing so halves the creature’s Hit Points. Once you cast the spell without a spell slot, you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast the spell in this way again.
Level 10: Undead Secrets
You have learned more secrets about the nuances of life and death. When you finish a Long Rest, you can expend a level 4+ spell slot to protect yourself from death. Until you finish a Long Rest, the next time you would drop to 0 Hit Points, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to ten times the spell slot expended.
In addition, immediately after you take damage and are Bloodied after taking that damage but not killed outright, you can take a Reaction and teleport to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet from yourself, and each creature within 10 feet of the space you left takes 2d10 Necrotic damage.
Level 14: Death's Master
Abstruse rituals within your spellbook allow you mastery over forces of death. While holding your spellbook, you gain the following benefits.
Bolster Undead.
As a Bonus Action, choose any number of Undead you have created or summoned with a Necromancy spell that are within 60 feet of yourself. Those Undead each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Wizard level. Once an Undead gains Temporary Hit Points from this feature, it can’t gain them in this way again for the next 24 hours.
Harvest Power.
When you use Grim Harvest, the creature that gains Temporary Hit Points gains one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until the end of the target’s next turn:
The target has Advantage on attack rolls.
The target has Advantage on the next saving throw it makes.
