Step Across Space and Call Creatures from Thin Air
You consider distance and matter to be flexible guidelines rather than physical laws. Conjurers harness the power of magic that moves creatures instantly through space and summons creatures to fight on their behalf.
Level 3: Benign Transposition
As a Magic action, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Medium or smaller creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot (no action required).
Level 3: Conjuration Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Conjuration school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Conjuration school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 6: Distant Transposition
The range of your Benign Transposition feature increases to 60 feet. Additionally, you regain your expended use of it when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
Level 6: Durable Summons
When you cast a Conjuration spell to summon or create another creature using a spell slot, that creature gains Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wizard level when it first appears.
Level 10: Focused Conjuration
Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on Conjuration spells.
Level 14: Quick Transposition
You can use Benign Transposition as a Bonus Action.
You can also use Benign Transposition as a Reaction when a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, but only to swap places with a willing creature. The creature that swaps places with you becomes the target of that attack instead.
