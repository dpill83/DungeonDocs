Entrance and Beguile Others
Your magic clouds or captivates minds. Some Enchanters use their abilities to encourage peace and soften cruelty, while others use their mind altering magic for selfish ends. Many Enchanters fall somewhere in between.
Level 3: Enchanting Talker
Whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
You also gain proficiency in one of these skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.
Level 3: Enchantment Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Enchantment school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Enchantment school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Vexing Movement
Immediately after you cast an Enchantment spell using an action and a spell slot, you can take both the Disengage and Dash actions as a Bonus Action.
You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 6: Reflecting Charm
When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to half your Wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this Reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot (no action required).
Level 10: Split Enchantment
When you cast an Enchantment spell, such as
Charm Person
, that can be cast with a higher level spell slot to target an additional creature, increase the spell’s effective level by 1.
Level 14: Bolstering Belief
Your enchantments fortify your allies’ bodies and minds. You always have
Power Word Fortify
prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, and each target of the spell has Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed and Frightened conditions while it has Temporary Hit Points granted by this spell.
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.
