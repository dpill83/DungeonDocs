# Spell Mental Prison

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within range must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 8d10 Psychic damage and have the Charmed condition for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half damage only and the spell ends.
While Charmed, the target has the Restrained condition and perceives the area around its space as dangerous to it in some way you create. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can’t see or hear anything beyond it. If the target is moved from the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 5d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends.
