Craft Magic Elixirs and Potions
An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce magical effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away.
Level 3: Tool Proficiency.
You gain proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.
In addition, when you brew a potion using the crafting rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, the amount of time required to craft it is halved.
Level 3: Alchemist Spells.
When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Alchemist Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 3: Experimental Elixir.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest while holding Alchemist’s Supplies, you can use that tool to magically produce two elixirs. For each elixir, roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir’s effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. The elixir appears in a vial, and the vial vanishes when the elixir is drunk or poured out. If any elixir remains when you finish a Long Rest, the elixir and its vial vanish.
Drinking an Elixir.
As a Bonus Action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of itself.
Creating Additional Elixirs.
As a Magic action while holding Alchemist’s Supplies, you can expend one spell slot to create another elixir. When you do so, you choose its effect from the Experimental Elixir table rather than rolling. When you reach certain Artificer levels, you can make an additional elixir at the end of each Long Rest: a total of three at level 5, four at level 9, and five at level 15.

Level 5: Alchemical Savant.
Whenever you cast a spell using your Alchemist’s Supplies as the Spellcasting Focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore Hit Points or be a damage roll that deals Acid, Fire, Necrotic, or Poison damage. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum bonus of +1).
Level 9: Restorative Reagents
You can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works, granting the following benefits:
Fortify.
Whenever a creature drinks an elixir you created with the Experimental Elixir feature, the creature gains Temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your Artificer level.
Restore.
You can cast
Lesser Restoration
without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use Alchemist’s Supplies as the Spellcasting Focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 15: Chemical Mastery.
You gain the following benefits:
Alchemical Eruption.
When you cast an Artificer spell that deals Acid, Fire, Necrotic, or Poison damage to a target, you can also deal 2d8 Force damage to that target. You can use this benefit only once on each of your turns.
Chemical Resistance.
You gain Resistance to Acid damage and Poison damage.
Conjured Cauldron.
You can cast
Tasha’s Bubbling Cauldron
without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without Material components, provided you use Alchemist’s Supplies as the Spellcasting Focus. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
