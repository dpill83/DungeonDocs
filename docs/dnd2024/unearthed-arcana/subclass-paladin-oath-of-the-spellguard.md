# Subclass Paladin Oath Of The Spellguard

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Paladins who take the Oath of the Spellguard are sworn to battle those who use magic to harm others.
They often serve as bodyguards to upstanding mages, but their most important role is protecting allies from devastating magical attacks. Those who swear this oath ensure that villains who misuse magic are brought to justice.
These paladins share the following tenets:
• Protect the innocent from wicked mages.
• Prevent magic from falling into villains’ hands.
• Protect mages who use magic honorably.
Level 3: Guardian Bond
As a Magic Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to forge a divine bond with a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you have the Unconscious condition. For the duration, while the bonded creature is within your reach and is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to that creature’s AC, possibly causing the attack to miss.
You can end your divine bond at any time (no action required). If you already have a divine bond when you forge a new one, the previous bond ends.
Level 3: Oath of the Spellguard Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of the Spellguard Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
