You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 Psychic damage, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
