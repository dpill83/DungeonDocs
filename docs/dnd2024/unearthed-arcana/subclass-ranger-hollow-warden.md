# Subclass Ranger Hollow Warden

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Draw on the Might of Ancient Wild Terrors
Legends tell that the most ancient and fearsome terrors lurk deep within the old places of the earth—unfathomable, bloodthirsty entities of fallow soil and sharpened claws.
Hollow Wardens venerate and draw power from such beings, transforming themselves into merciless and monstrous guardians that stalk along jagged coastlines, across steep mountain crags, and through other dark and wild places.
Level 3: Hollow Warden Spells
When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Hollow Warden Spells table, you always have the corresponding spells prepared, and they don’t count against the number of Ranger spells you can prepare.

Level 3: Wrath of the Wild
You draw on the strange and ancient horrors of the land for power. When you cast
Hunter’s Mark
, you transform for the duration of the spell, gaining the following benefits:
Ancient Armor.
You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). Your body becomes shrouded in rotten bark or beastly bristles.
Unnerving Aura.
When an enemy starts its turn within a 10-foot Emanation originating from you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.
On a failed save, the creature can take either an Action or a Bonus Action, not both, on that turn.
Your shadow lengthens and twists, or unnatural growths like bloody antlers or putrid fangs sprout from your body.
Level 7: Hungering Might
You become harder to kill and more predatory:
You gain a bonus to Constitution saving throws equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
Additionally, once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack roll while transformed by Wrath of the Wild, and you are Bloodied (at or below half your HP), you regain 1d10 plus your Wisdom modifier Hit Points.
Level 11: Rot and Violence
Your dedication to the eldritch forest beings alters you further. While transformed using Wrath of the Wild, you gain these additional effects:
Eerie Aura.
When a creature fails its saving throw against your Unnerving Aura, it also takes Necrotic, Poison, or Psychic damage (your choice) equal to your Ranger level.
This damage ignores Resistance.
Strangling Roots.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can activate the Sap or Slow mastery property in addition to any other mastery property you’re using with that weapon.
Level 15: Ancient Endurance
You become wholly suffused with the forest’s ancient power, gaining the following benefits:
Persistent Hunt.
If you drop to 0 Hit Points while transformed by Wrath of the Wild and don’t die outright, you can expend a 4th-level or higher spell slot (no action required).
Your Hit Points instead become equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot expended.
Timeless.
You gain Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.
