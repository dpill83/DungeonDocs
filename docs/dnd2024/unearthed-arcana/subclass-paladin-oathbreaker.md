# Subclass Paladin Oathbreaker

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


The power of a Paladin’s oath is so great that it holds a distorted power even when it is violated.
When a Paladin betrays the tenets of their oath because of corruption, pride, or thirst for power, they lose the blessing granted by their original oath but sometimes take on the sinister blessing of the Oathbreaker in its place. Oathbreakers use fear and overwhelming power to achieve their goals. While many Oathbreakers are beyond redemption, some Paladins bend this oath to achieve a great and noble deed to atone for their past evils.
At the DM’s discretion, a Paladin of any level who violates the tenets of their oath can lose the benefits granted by their original subclass and gain the features of the Oathbreaker subclass instead. Alternatively, a Paladin can choose this subclass at level 3 based on the character’s backstory of falling from grace.
These Paladins often share the following tenets:
• Fear is a tool in the hands of the powerful.
• Strive for power at any cost.
• Do what must be done, but never lose sight of your goal.
Level 3: Conjure Undead
As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to summon a number of Undead equal to half your Charisma modifier (round up; minimum of one Undead summoned).
Each Undead appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you and is a type of your choice: Skeleton or Zombie (see appendix B of the Player’s Handbook for the stat blocks).
The Undead are under your control for 1 minute, after which they dissolve into ash.
Each Undead is an ally to you and your allies.
In combat, the Undead shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
Level 3: Dreadful Aspect
Immediately after you cast
Divine Smite
, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to channel a burst of magical menace. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Level 3: Oathbreaker Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oathbreaker Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).
Darkness.
