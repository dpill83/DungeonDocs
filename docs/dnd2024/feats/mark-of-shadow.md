Dragonmark Feat (Prerequisite: Eberron Campaign, Can’t Have Another Dragonmark Feat)

You gain the following benefits.

**Cunning Intuition**  
When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) or Charisma (Performance) check, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Shape Shadows**  
You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. You also always have the Invisibility spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).

**Spells of the Mark**  
If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Mark of Shadow Spells table are added to that feature’s spell list.
