You gain the following benefits.

**Hex.**  
You always have the Hex spell prepared. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

**Curse Magic.**  
When a creature that you’ve cursed with Hex hits you with an attack roll, the creature takes Psychic damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.
