Dragonmark Feat (Prerequisite: Eberron Campaign, Can’t Have Another Dragonmark Feat)

You gain the following benefits.

**Gifted Scribe**  
When you make an Intelligence (History) check or an ability check using Calligrapher’s Supplies, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Scribe’s Insight**  
You know the Message cantrip. You also always have the Comprehend Languages spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).  
When you reach character level 3, you also always have the Magic Mouth spell prepared and can cast it the same way.

**Spells of the Mark**  
If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Scribing Spells table are added to that feature’s spell list.
