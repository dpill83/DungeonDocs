You gain the following benefits.

**Magic Absorption**  
Once per turn, when you take damage from a spell or magical effect, you reduce the total damage taken by 1d4. You can’t use this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition.

**Spellfire Flame**  
You learn the Sacred Flame cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). You can also cast this cantrip as a Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
