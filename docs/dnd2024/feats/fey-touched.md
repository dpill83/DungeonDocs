Your exposure to the Feywild's magic grants you the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase**  
Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Fey Magic**  
Choose one level 1 spell from the Divination or Enchantment school of magic. You always have that spell and the Misty Step spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
