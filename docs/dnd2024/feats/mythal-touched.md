If a spell attack hits you or you fail a saving throw against a spell, you can take a Reaction to roll on the Mythal-Touched Magic table to create a magical effect. If an effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus the modifier of the ability increased by this feat and your Proficiency Bonus.
You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
