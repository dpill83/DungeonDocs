*General Feat*  
*Prerequisite: Level 4+, Mark of Healing feat*

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.**  
Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Improved Intuition.**  
When you use the Medical Intuition benefit of your Mark of Healing feat, you can roll 1d6 instead of 1d4.

**Improved Healing.**  
You can now use the Healing Touch benefit of your Mark of Healing feat to cast *Cure Wounds* without using a spell slot a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  

Additionally, when you cast *Cure Wounds* and roll dice to determine the number of Hit Points restored, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a roll as a 3.
