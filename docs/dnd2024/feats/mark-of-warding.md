Dragonmark Feat (Prerequisite: Eberron Campaign, Can’t Have Another Dragonmark Feat)

You gain the following benefits.

**Warder’s Intuition**  
When you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check or an ability check using Thieves’ Tools, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Wards and Seals**  
You always have the Alarm and Mage Armor spells prepared. You can cast each spell once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).

When you reach character level 3, you also always have the Arcane Lock spell prepared and can cast it the same way.

**Spells of the Mark**  
If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Mark of Warding Spells table are added to that feature’s spell list.
