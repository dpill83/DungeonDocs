Dragonmark Feat (Prerequisite: Eberron Campaign, Can’t Have Another Dragonmark Feat)

You gain the following benefits.

**Artisan’s Intuition**  
When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check or an ability check using Artisan’s Tools, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Spellsmith**  
You know the mending cantrip. You also always have the magic weapon spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).

**Spells of the Mark**  
If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Making Spells table are added to that feature’s spell list.
