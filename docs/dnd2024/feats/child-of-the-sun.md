You gain the following benefits.

**Eyes of Eirdu**  
You and allies within 10 feet of you have Advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the Blinded condition.

**Faerie Fire**  
You learn the Faerie Fire spell. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

When you cast Faerie Fire without a spell slot using this benefit, taking damage can’t break your Concentration on the spell.
