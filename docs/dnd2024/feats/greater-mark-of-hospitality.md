General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Mark of Hospitality Feat)

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase**  
Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Improved Intuition**  
When you use the Ever Hospitable benefit of your Mark of Hospitality feat, you can roll 1d6 instead of 1d4.

**Inspired Hospitality**  
When you cast *Purify Food and Drink*, you can modify the spell so that instead of its normal effect, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you is refreshed. Each affected creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced by 1, and the creature gains Temporary Hit Points equal to your Proficiency Bonus plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this feat). Once you modify the spell with this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
