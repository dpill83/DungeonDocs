General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+,
Mark of Handling
Feat)
You gain the following benefits.
Ability Score Increase.
Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Improved Intuition.
When you use the Wild Intuition benefit of your Mark of Handling feat, you can roll 1d6 instead of 1d4.
Improved Handling.
While you are mounted, immediately after you hit a target within 5 feet of your mount with a melee attack roll, your mount can take a Reaction to move up to its Speed or take the Attack action to make one attack only (your choice).
Subdue Animal.
As a Magic action, you exert command over one Beast or Monstrosity you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or have the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
