You always have the
Shield
spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).
Vigilant Guardian.
When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to swap places with that creature, and you are hit by the attack instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Spells of the Mark.
If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Sentinel Spells table are added to that feature’s spell list.
