You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.**  
Increase your Strength or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Standard Bearer.**  
As a Bonus Action, choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of yourself that can see you. Each target can immediately take a Reaction to right itself and end the Prone condition, provided its Speed isn’t 0.  
Additionally, you bolster the targets’ resolve, which lasts for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. While bolstered, a target can’t be possessed or gain the Charmed or Frightened condition; if a target is already possessed, Charmed, or Frightened, the target has Advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.  
Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
