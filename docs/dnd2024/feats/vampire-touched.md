You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase**  
Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Vampire Magic**  
Choose one level 1 spell from the Enchantment or Illusion school of magic. You always have that spell and the Spider Climb spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot, but when you cast Spider Climb this way, you must target yourself, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast each spell in this way again. You can also cast either spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Your spellcasting ability for the spells is the ability increased by this feat.
