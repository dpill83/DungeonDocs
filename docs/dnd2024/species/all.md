When you choose your character's species, you determine whether they're human or a member of a fantastical race like dragonborn or gnome. A character's species defines their game traits—the mechanical benefits and characteristics they gain from their ancestry.

Species in the D&D multiverse originate from different worlds, planes, and gods, though members have spread across the realms and contributed to many cultures. Most species members live roughly 80 years (with exceptions noted in their descriptions), and all species reach physical maturity at approximately the same age. Your character can be any age within their species' normal life span.

## Parts of a Species

Every species provides the following:

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Creature Type** | Your species determines your creature type (described in the rules glossary). All playable species in this chapter are Humanoid. |
| **Size** | Your species determines your size category. Most species are Medium, though some can be Small or Medium—you choose. |
| **Speed** | Your species determines your walking speed in feet. |
| **Special Traits** | Each species grants unique traits reflecting its physiology or magical nature. You gain all listed traits for your species, and some offer choices. |
