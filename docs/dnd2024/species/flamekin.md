Flamekin are people made from two key elements of creation: fire and stone. As a result, many flamekin feel a strong connection to the natural world. Flamekin’s bodies radiate harmless magical flames, though they possess innate magic that allows them to create burning flames in a multitude of forms.  
Flamekin view self-discovery and self-expression the noblest of aspirations and believe that self-realization is the most important thing an individual can do with their life. Flamekin call this lifelong pursuit the Path of Flame.  
Flamekin dwell in either Lorwyn or Shadowmoor. Physically and culturally, they are similar in both lands.

You know the *Produce Flame* cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the *Burning Hands* spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the *Flame Blade* spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast *Burning Hands* or *Flame Blade* with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.  
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
