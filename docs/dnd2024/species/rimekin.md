Rimekin hail from both Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, though the first rimekin arose from flamekin during the Phyrexian invasion. These flamekin approached their problems with cold logic and rejected reactionary responses. As a result, the magical flames that engulfed their bodies took on a frigid air, and they became rimekin.  
Like flamekin, rimekin possess innate magic, but the flames they conjure burn icy blue rather than red hot. Further, these “flames” emanate a chilling cold rather than blazing heat. This effect extends, superficially, to the items rimekin touch. Any armor worn or weapons wielded by rimekin become coated in layers of spiky yet harmless hoarfrost.

As a Rimekin, you have these special traits.

**Cold Fire Magic.**  
You know the  
Ray of Frost  
cantrip. When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn the  
Ice Knife  
spell and the  
Flame Blade  
spell, respectively. You always have those spells prepared. You can cast each once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast these spells in this way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. When you cast  
Flame Blade  
using this trait, the spell deals Cold damage instead of Fire damage.  
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose the ability when you select this species).

**Cold Resistance.**  
You have Resistance to Cold damage.

**Darkvision.**  
You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
