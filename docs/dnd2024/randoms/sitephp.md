Welcome to the Spring 2009 MNT I Wiki!
**REMINDER: Be sure to put your names on each section you do. I am seeing some wonderful info. on the wiki but with no name. Mrs. Roofe wants to know who did what so be sure to put your name on each section you complete! It is looking great!
Thanks,
Jai
***REMEMBER THE WIKI IS DUE MONDAY, APRIL 20.
I have updated my disease, which is hypertension, so that everyone can see what it will look like after they update something. I only updated the etiology portion. To get there you will need to click on "hypertension" under the "page tags" section on the lefthand side. Once you click on that you will be taken to another page that says "hypertension" and you will click on that to view the updated info.
Thanks,
Jai
All diseases have been now added under the "page tags" section on the lefthand side of the site. You should now only have to click on your disease or one of the words in your disease to take you to the link to edit the info. Once you click on your disease under "page tags" you will have to click on the link it takes you to for access to the page you will edit. Please let me know if you have anymore questions!
Thanks
Jai
To get to all of the diseases you can click on list all pages or you can click on the words under the "page tags". All of the diseases are not under the page tags yet but they are under "list all pages". You might have to scroll down a little before you find your disease. If you have forgotten what topic you had you can click on the word "Diseases" under the page tags and it will bring up all of the diseases and who signed up for them. I am working on getting all of the diseases named under the page tags section but they are not going in alphbetical order of diseases they are going in alphabetical order of the individaul words. For example, if you have congestive heart failure you can click on the word conjestive, heart, or failure and they will all 3 take you to conjestive heart failure tab. When you get there just click on the tab labeled "conjestive heart failure". It will take you to the list of etiology, signs, symptoms, ect. To edit the information you can scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "edit" on the lower right hand side. You may they type in your info. Be sure to put your name at the end of each section you update so that Mrs. Roofe will know who updated what! Once you have edited everything you click "save". Remember you do not have to do this all at once. You can go in and edit at any time as long as you save your info. If you have any questions please let me know! I will continue adding the diseases under "page tags". Until then those that have not been added your diseases will be under "list all pages".
Thanks,
Jai
