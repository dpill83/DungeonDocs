Fall of a Bastion
A Bastion is a location that belongs to a player character: a home, a stronghold, and a place of power that the character develops over the course of a campaign. A Bastion offers a character temporary refuge from the dangerous world of adventuring, and it provides opportunities for a character to craft magic items, conduct research, harvest poisons, build ships, and carry out a range of other activities.
As DM, you decide whether Bastions are available in a campaign. Bastions are best suited to campaigns that allow characters to return to their Bastions during intervals when they’re not actively adventuring. Not every character needs to have a Bastion. It’s fine for some players in your campaign to opt in to Bastion ownership and others to opt out.
There’s no need to choose between going on adventures and commanding a Bastion; a character can do both at once. A Bastion has special facilities that generate benefits, and these facilities can also undertake projects while the character is otherwise occupied.
Most importantly, a Bastion is a creative playground for a player and a shared storytelling space in the campaign. Be as permissive as you can with the stories players tell in their Bastions, but players should know their control might be limited by the campaign’s larger story, which you strive to make fun for everyone.
Gaining a Bastion
If you allow Bastions in your campaign, characters acquire their Bastions when they reach level 5. You and the players can decide together how these Bastions come into being. A character might inherit or receive a parcel of land on which to build their Bastion, or they might take a preexisting structure and refurbish it. It’s fair to assume that work has been going on behind the scenes of the campaign during a character’s early adventuring career, so the Bastion is ready when the character reaches level 5.
The shape, style, and function of a character’s Bastion are up to the player to determine. For example, a Wizard might build a tower, a Cleric might establish a shrine, a Fighter might build a fortified keep or similar stronghold, and a Rogue might establish a guildhall or lodge. Characters of other classes might choose one of these forms or combine them—a Paladin’s Bastion might be similar to a Cleric’s shrine but as fortified as a Fighter’s stronghold. And multiple characters can combine their Bastions to form a single large structure (see “Bastion Map”).
Every Bastion has facilities that serve basic needs as well as special ones, such as libraries, menageries, and workshops (see “Basic Facilities” and “Special Facilities”).
Bastion Turns
As time passes in the campaign, players take Bastion turns to reflect the activity occurring in their Bastions, whether or not the characters are present. On a Bastion turn, a character can issue orders to the special facilities in their Bastion or issue the Maintain order to the entire Bastion (see “Orders”).
Frequency of Bastion Turns
By default, a Bastion turn occurs every 7 days of in-game time. Here are common examples of players taking one or more Bastion turns:
The characters are on a long journey away from their Bastions. After the characters have been away for 7 days, you might say, “Time for a Bastion turn. Since you’re not there, we’ll assume you issue the Maintain order for your Bastions.” Then roll for events as described in the “Bastion Events” section in this chapter.
The characters spend 7 days or more in their Bastions between adventures. You might say, “You have six weeks to spend in your Bastions. Go ahead and resolve six Bastion turns.”
The characters return to their Bastions in the midst of an adventure. You might say, “You have just enough time to take a Bastion turn before you leave again in the morning.”
The characters are adventuring near their Bastions and resting in their Bastions at night. You might say, “It’s been a week since your last Bastion turn, so you can take one now.”
You can slow the frequency of Bastion turns to better serve the needs of your players and your campaign. For example, if the characters have months between adventures, you can call for a Bastion turn every month instead of every 7 days, so the characters aren’t issuing so many orders or reaping too many benefits at once.
Bastion Map
Encourage players to create floor plans of their characters’ Bastions, configuring its facilities as they see fit and using the same techniques you use to create dungeon maps.
In addition to basic and special facilities, a Bastion can have the following features:
Closets.
A basic or special facility can have one or more closets, washrooms, or similar enclosures. The closets must be inside the facility and can’t increase the facility’s area in squares. These features are free.
Corridors, Ramps, and Staircases.
A facility can contain one or more corridors, ramps, or staircases leading to other facilities in the Bastion. These features are free.
Defensive Walls.
A character can add defensive walls around their Bastion. A defensive wall is 20 feet high and may include a walkway along its top, with a means to access it (such as a ladder or lift). Each 5-foot square of defensive wall takes 10 days to build and costs 250 GP. If a character’s Bastion is completely enclosed by defensive walls and it comes under attack (see “Bastion Events” at the end of this chapter), reduce by 2 the number of dice rolled to determine how many Bastion Defenders are lost in the attack.
Doors and Windows.
Each facility comes with one or more doors and shuttered windows, placed wherever the player sees fit. See “Doors” in chapter 3 for kinds of doors to choose from, including locked doors, secret doors, and portcullises. These features are free.
Mobile Bastions
The Bastion rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide assume that characters establish their Bastions in a fixed location and that their adventures might take them away from their Bastions at times, perhaps even for long periods. But in Eberron (and perhaps other settings), characters might establish a permanent base of operations that isn’t linked to a fixed location—maybe on a sailing ship, a lightning rail cart, or even an airship. The DM decides whether to allow characters to establish a mobile Bastion, which uses the following alterations to the normal Bastion rules.
A mobile Bastion has two basic requirements: it must be built in a vehicle form, and one of its special facilities must allow for propulsion. (The Lyrandar Helm, Navigator’s Helm, and Orien Helm fulfill that requirement.) If multiple characters combine their Bastions into a single vehicle, each Bastion must include the same kind of special facility that allows for propulsion, and in order for the vehicle to travel, the characters must all issue the Empower order to those facilities at the same time. In this case, however, the combined Bastion can travel more than 8 hours per day; the facility hirelings can operate the vehicle in shifts. Thus, a combined Bastion with at least three Navigator’s Helm facilities can sail for 24 hours a day as the three hirelings trade off navigation in 8-hour shifts.
If characters are traveling with their mobile Bastions, they can also have encounters and face obstacles just as if they were traveling away from their Bastions. When the DM is planning obstacles for such a journey (as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide), a potential consequence of an encounter or obstacle is the temporary loss of access to one or more of the Bastion’s facilities, including the facility that allows propulsion.
Players and the DM should work together to create a Bastion map that fits within the chosen vehicle. Facilities can be slightly larger or smaller than the rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide specify, at the DM’s discretion, in order to fit. A mobile Bastion can’t have defensive walls.
Combining Bastions
Two or more players can combine their characters’ Bastions into a single structure. Doing so doesn’t change the number of special facilities each Bastion can have, how those special facilities work, or who issues orders to each Bastion. Each Bastion retains its own hirelings, which can’t be sent to or shared with another Bastion. Bastion Defenders are handled differently: if some event deprives one character’s Bastion of defenders, another character can apply all or some of those losses to their Bastion instead, provided the two Bastions are combined.
Facility Space
The amount of space in a basic or special facility determines its maximum area in 5-foot squares, as shown in the Facility Space table. A player can configure the squares of a facility as they please on their Bastion’s map. The squares can be stacked so that a facility’s area is distributed over multiple levels or stories.
Space
Maximum Area
Cramped
4 Squares
Roomy
16 Squares
Vast
36 Squares
Basic Facilities
A character’s Bastion starts with two free basic facilities, which the character’s player chooses from the Basic Facilities list below. One of the chosen facilities is Cramped, and the other is Roomy (see the Facility Space table). A Bastion can have more than one of each basic facility.
Basic Facilities
Bedroom
Dining Room
Parlor
Courtyard
Kitchen
Storage
A basic facility comes with nonmagical furnishings and decor appropriate for that facility.
Basic facilities don’t have any game effects, but they can inspire roleplaying opportunities and enhance a Bastion’s verisimilitude. A Bastion with a kitchen is functionally the same as one without, but the former gives you and your players a fun setting to start game sessions, have in-character discussions, or introduce new NPCs.
A character can add new basic facilities or enlarge existing ones by spending money and time, as discussed in the sections that follow. Any number of basic facilities can be added or enlarged at the same time. A character doesn’t need to be in their Bastion while basic facilities are being added or enlarged.
Adding Basic Facilities
A character can add a basic facility to their Bastion by spending money and time. The cost of adding a basic facility and the time required depend on the facility’s space, as shown on the table below.
Facility Space

Enlarging Basic Facilities
There is no in-game benefit to enlarging a basic facility, but a character might enlarge a facility for cosmetic reasons or to increase the Bastion’s size.
A character can spend money and time to increase the space of a basic facility in their Bastion by one category, as shown on the table below.

Special Facilities
Special facilities are Bastion locations where certain activities yield game benefits. A character’s Bastion initially has two special facilities of the character’s choice for which they qualify. Each special facility can be chosen only once unless its description says otherwise.
Unlike basic facilities, special facilities can’t be bought; a character gains them through level advancement. At level 9, a character gains two additional special facilities of their choice for which they qualify; they gain one additional facility at level 13 and another at level 17. The Special Facility Acquisition table shows the total number of special facilities in a character’s Bastion. Each new special facility immediately becomes part of the character’s Bastion when the character reaches the level.
Each time a character gains a level, that character can replace one of their Bastion’s special facilities with another for which the character qualifies.

Requirements
Each special facility has a level. A character must be that level or higher to gain that facility. A special facility might also have a prerequisite the character must meet to gain that facility. For example, only a character who can use an Arcane Focus or a tool as a Spellcasting Focus can have an Arcane Study.
Space
A special facility occupies a certain amount of space (see “Facility Space”). A player can configure the squares of a special facility as desired on the Bastion’s map. A special facility can be enlarged to grant additional benefits if its description says so.
Hirelings
A special facility comes with one or more hirelings who work in the facility, maintain it, and execute Bastion orders there, as described in the next section. A player can assign names and personalities to hirelings in their character’s Bastion using the same tools DMs use to create NPCs.
Each special facility in a Bastion generates enough income to pay the salary of its hirelings. Hirelings follow the orders they’re given and are loyal to the Bastion’s owner.
Orders
On a Bastion turn, a character in their Bastion can issue special orders - called Bastion orders - to one or more of their Bastion’s special facilities. A character needn’t issue orders to all the special facilities in their Bastion on a given Bastion turn.
The Maintain order is unusual; it is issued to the whole Bastion rather than to one or more special facilities. If a character isn’t in their Bastion on a given Bastion turn, the Bastion acts as though it were issued the Maintain order on that turn unless the owner can communicate with the Bastion hirelings using the
Sending spell
or similar magic.
The orders are as follows:
Craft
Hirelings in the special facility craft an item that can be made in that facility. During the time required to craft an item, the facility can’t be used to craft anything else, even if a special ability allows the facility to carry out two orders at once. The hirelings have proficiencies with Artisan’s Tools as specified in the facility’s description.
Empower
The special facility confers a temporary empowerment to you or someone else.
Harvest
Hirelings gather a resource produced in the special facility. During the time required to harvest a resource, the facility can’t be used to harvest anything else, even if a special ability allows the facility to carry out two orders at once.
Maintain
All the Bastion’s hirelings focus on maintaining the Bastion rather than executing orders in special facilities. Issuing this order prohibits other orders from being issued to the Bastion on the current Bastion turn. Each time the Maintain order is issued, the DM rolls once on the Bastion Events table. Bastion events are resolved before the next Bastion turn.
Recruit
Hirelings recruit creatures to the Bastion. These creatures might include one or more Bastion Defenders, whose main purpose is to defend the Bastion if it is attacked (see “Bastion Events”). The Bastion generates enough income to provide for the needs of its Bastion Defenders.
Research
Hirelings in the special facility gather information.
Trade
Hirelings buy and sell goods or services stored or produced in this special facility.

Arcane Study
Level 5 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Ability to use an Arcane Focus or tool as a Spellcasting Focus
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Craft
An Arcane Study is a place of quiet research that contains one or more desks and bookshelves.
Arcane Study Charm.
After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts”) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast
Identify
without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it.
Craft Options.
When you issue the Craft order to this facility, choose one of the following options:
Craft:
Arcane Focus. You commission the facility’s hireling to craft an Arcane Focus. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The Arcane Focus remains in your Bastion until you claim it.
Craft: Book.
You commission the facility’s hireling to craft a blank book. The work takes 7 days and costs you 10 GP. The book remains in your Bastion until you claim it.
Craft: Magic Item (Arcana).
If you are level 9+, you can commission the facility’s hireling to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Arcana tables in chapter 7. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hireling has proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s hireling can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.
Archive
Level 13 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Research
An Archive is a repository of valuable books, maps, and scrolls. It is usually attached to a Library behind a locked or secret door.
Research: Helpful Lore.
When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to search the Archive for helpful lore. The work takes 7 days. The hireling gains knowledge as if they had cast the
Legend Lore
spell, then shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them.
Reference Book.
Your Archive contains one copy of a rare and valuable reference book, which gives you a benefit while you and the book are in your Bastion. You can choose one of the following options (your DM might make more options available):
Bigby’s Handy Arcana Codex.
You have Advantage on any Intelligence (Arcana) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, and planes of existence.
The Chronepsis Chronicles.
You have Advantage on any Intelligence (History) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, wars, and lost civilizations.
Investigations of the Inquisitive.
You have Advantage on any Intelligence (Investigation) check you make when you take the Study action to make deductions based on clues or evidence or to recall lore about traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry.
Material Musings on the Nature of the World.
You have Advantage on any Intelligence (Nature) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and the weather.
The Old Faith and Other Religions.
You have Advantage on any Intelligence (Religion) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

You can enlarge your Archive to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, you gain two additional reference books chosen from the list above.
Armory
Level 5 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Trade
An Armory contains mannequins for displaying armor, hooks for holding Shields, racks for storing weapons, and chests for holding ammunition.
Trade: Stock Armory.
When you issue the Trade order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to stock the Armory with armor, Shields, weapons, and ammunition. This equipment costs you 100 GP plus an extra 100 GP for each Bastion Defender in your Bastion. If your Bastion has a Smithy, the total cost is halved.
While your Armory is stocked, your Bastion Defenders are harder to kill. When any event causes you to roll dice to determine if your Bastion loses one or more of its defenders (see “Bastion Events” at the end of this chapter), roll 1d8 in place of each d6 you would normally roll. When the event is over, the equipment in your Armory is expended regardless of how many Bastion Defenders you have or how many you lost, leaving your Armory depleted until you issue another Trade order to the facility and pay the cost to restock it.
Barrack
Level 5 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Recruit
A Bastion can have more than one Barrack, each of which is furnished to serve as sleeping quarters for up to twelve Bastion Defenders.
Recruit: Bastion Defenders.
Each time you issue the Recruit order to this facility, up to four Bastion Defenders are recruited to your Bastion and assigned quarters in this Barrack. The recruitment costs no money. You can’t issue the Recruit order to this facility if it’s fully occupied.
Keep track of the Bastion Defenders housed in each of your Barracks. If you lose Bastion Defenders, deduct them from your roster. Assign names and personalities to your Bastion Defenders as you see fit.
Enlarging the Facility.
You can enlarge your Barrack to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. A Vast Barrack can accommodate up to twenty-five Bastion Defenders.
Demiplane
Level 17 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Ability to use an Arcane Focus or a tool as a Spellcasting Focus
Space:
Vast
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Empower
A door up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall appears on a flat, solid surface in one of the other facilities in your Bastion. You choose the location. If you are in your Bastion during a Bastion turn, you can relocate this door to another facility in your Bastion.
Only you and your Bastion’s hirelings can open the door, which leads to a Demiplane that takes the form of a stone room. The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore isn’t attached physically to other locations in your Bastion. Neither the Demiplane nor its door can be dispelled.
Empower: Arcane Resilience.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, magical runes appear on the Demiplane’s walls and last for 7 days. Until the runes disappear, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to five times your level after spending an entire Long Rest in the Demiplane.
Fabrication.
While in the Demiplane, you can take a Magic action to create a nonmagical object of your choice from nothing, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space in the Demiplane. The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can’t have a value over 5 GP; and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal. You must finish a Long Rest before you can take this action again.

Harvest: Garden Growth.
When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to collect items from the Garden as noted in the Garden Types table. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.
Enlarging the Facility.
You can enlarge your Garden to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. A Vast Garden is equivalent to two Roomy Gardens and can include two of the same type of Garden or two different types.

Adventurers’ Guild
Lit torch
You send adventurers to track down a Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 2 or lower and is known to lair within 50 miles of your Bastion. The adventurers slay or capture the creature (your choice) in 1d6 + 1 days. If the creature is slain and your Bastion has a Trophy Room, you can add a trophy taken from the creature to that facility. If the creature is captured and your Bastion has a Menagerie, you can add the creature to that facility, provided the facility has space to house it.
Bakers’ Guild
Pastry
You assign bakers to create baked goods for a prestigious event that occurs within the next 7 days. You can receive payment in coin (500 GP) or in the form of a favor owed to you by the event’s host, the details of which are left to you and the DM.
Brewers’ Guild
Foaming mug
You assign brewers to deliver fifty 40-gallon barrels of ale (worth 10 GP each) to your Bastion in 7 days.
Masons’ Guild
Stone mask
You assign masons to add a defensive wall to your Bastion at no cost. Alternatively, you can have the masons perform this work for another character’s Bastion, provided their Bastion is within 1 mile of yours.

Menagerie
Level 13 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Vast
Hirelings: 2
Order:
Recruit
A Menagerie has enclosures big enough to contain up to four Large creatures. Four Small or Medium creatures can occupy the same space as one Large creature there.
Recruit: Creature.
When you issue the Recruit order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hirelings to add a creature from the Menagerie Creatures table to your Menagerie. The recruitment takes 7 days and costs you the amount listed in the table. The hirelings look after the creature.
Creatures in your Menagerie count as Bastion Defenders. Deduct any you lose from your Bastion Defenders roster. You can choose not to count one or more of these creatures as Bastion Defenders, in which case they can’t be called on to defend the Bastion. Instead, they act in accordance with their nature and use their stat blocks in the Monster Manual.

Situated atop your Bastion, your Observatory contains a telescope aimed at the night sky.
Observatory Charm.
You can use your Observatory to peer into the far corners of Wildspace and the Astral Plane. After spending a Long Rest in your Observatory, you gain a magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 3) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast
Contact Other Plane
without expending a spell slot. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it.
Empower: Eldritch Discovery.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you enable yourself or the facility’s hireling to explore the eldritch mysteries of the stars for 7 consecutive nights. At the end of that time, roll a die. If the number rolled is even, nothing is gained. If the number rolled is odd, an unknown power bestows one of the following Charms on you or another creature of your choice that is on the same plane of existence as you: Charm of Darkvision, Charm of Heroism, or Charm of Vitality (all described in chapter 3).
Pub
Level 13 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Research
Folks come here to consume tasty beverages and socialize. Your Pub might be a bar, coffee shop, or tea room, and it might have a colorful name, such as the Rusty Flagon or the Dragon’s Loft. The facility’s hireling, who serves as the bartender, maintains a network of spies scattered throughout nearby communities. These spies are useful sources of information and frequent the Pub, often incognito.
Research: Information Gathering.
When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the Pub’s bartender to gather information from spies who are aware of all important events happening within 10 miles of your Bastion over the next 7 days. During that time, these spies can divulge the location of any creature that is familiar to you, provided the creature is within 50 miles of your Bastion and not hidden by magic or confined to a location that the DM deems is beyond the spy network’s ability to locate. If the spies learn the target’s location, they also learn where that creature has been for the previous 7 days.
Pub Special.
The Pub has one magical beverage on tap, chosen from the options below:
Bigby’s Burden.
Drinking a pint of this beverage grants you the “enlarge” effect of an
Enlarge/Reduce
spell that has a duration of 24 hours (no saving throw allowed).
Kiss of the Spider Queen.
Drinking a pint of this beverage grants you the effect of a
Spider Climb
spell that has a duration of 24 hours.
Moonlight Serenade.
Drinking a pint of this beverage gives you Darkvision out to 60 feet for 24 hours. If you already have Darkvision, its range is extended by 60 feet for the same duration.
Positive Reinforcement.
Drinking a pint of this beverage gives you Resistance to Necrotic damage for 24 hours.
Sterner Stuff.
For 24 hours after drinking a pint of this beverage, you automatically succeed on saving throws to avoid or end the Frightened condition.
At the start of a Bastion turn, you can switch to one of the other options. Your DM may create new options. A pint of this magical beverage loses its magic 24 hours after it’s poured.
Enlarging the Facility.
You can enlarge your Pub to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, the Pub can have two magical beverages from the Pub Special list on tap at a time. A Vast Pub gains three additional hirelings, for a total of four. These new hirelings are servers. Assign names and personalities to them as you see fit.

Greater Restoration
once without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it.
Harvest: Talisman.
When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you commission its hireling to produce a specially prepared talisman for your use. The talisman usually takes the form of an amulet, a rune-carved box, or a statuette, but it can be any Tiny, nonmagical object that has religious significance. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. You can use this talisman in place of one spell’s Material components, provided the components have a cost of 1,000 GP or less. If the spell normally consumes its components, the talisman isn’t consumed. After the talisman has been used in this way, it can’t be used again until you return it to your Reliquary and use another Harvest order to prepare it.

Craft: Magic Item (Relic).
You commission the facility’s hireling to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Relics tables in chapter 7. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hireling has proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s hireling can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.

The beneficiary doesn’t need to be in the Bastion when the rites are performed to gain their benefit. Each time the beneficiary finishes a Long Rest, they gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your level. This effect lasts for 7 days.
Sanctum Recall.
While the Sanctum exists, you always have the
Word of Recall
spell prepared. When you cast

Hirelings:
1
Order:
Trade
A Bastion can have more than one Stable. Each Stable you add to your Bastion comes with one Riding Horse or Camel and two Ponies or Mules; see the Player’s Handbook or the Monster Manual for these creatures’ stat blocks. The facility is big enough to house three Large animals. Two Medium creatures occupy the same amount of space as one Large creature there. The facility’s hireling looks after these creatures.
After a Beast that can serve as a mount spends at least 14 days in this facility, all Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made with respect to it have Advantage.
Trade: Animals.
When you issue the Trade order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to buy or sell one or more mounts at normal cost, keeping the ones you buy in your Stable. The work takes 7 days, and the DM decides what types of animals are available for purchase—horses, ponies, and mules being the most common. The Mounts and Other Animals table in the Player’s Handbook gives standard prices for various mounts. You bear the total cost of any purchases.
When you sell a mount from your Stable, the buyer pays you 20 percent more than the standard price; this profit increases to 50 percent when you reach level 13 and 100 percent when you reach level 17.

Each time you issue the Recruit order to this facility, its hireling extends an invitation to a Friendly NPC spellcaster. Roll any die. If the number rolled is odd, the invitee declines the invitation, and you gain no benefit from having issued the order. If the number rolled is even, the invitee accepts the invitation and arrives in your Bastion via your Teleportation Circle.
While you are in your Bastion, you can ask the spellcaster to cast one Wizard spell of level 4 or lower; if you are level 17+, the spell’s maximum level increases to 8. The spellcaster is assumed to have the spell prepared. If the spell has one or more Material components that cost money, you must pay for them before the spell can be cast.
The spellcaster stays for 14 days or until they cast a spell for you. The spellcaster won’t defend your Bastion and departs immediately if the Bastion is attacked (see “Bastion Events” at the end of the chapter).
Theater

The Theater contains a stage, a backstage area where props and sets are kept, and a seating area for a small audience.
Empower: Theatrical Event.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, its hirelings begin work on a theatrical production or concert. Rehearsals and other preparations take 14 days, followed by at least 7 days of performances. The performances can continue indefinitely until a new production gets underway.
You or another character can contribute to a production in the following ways:
Composer/Writer.
A character can compose music or write a script for a concert or production that hasn’t started rehearsals yet. This effort takes 14 days.
Conductor/Director.
A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the production can serve as the concert’s conductor or the production’s director.
Performer.
A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the rehearsal period can be a star performer in one or more of the performances; one of the Theater’s hirelings can serve as an understudy for additional performances.
At the end of a rehearsal period, each character who contributed to the concert or production can make a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. If more of these checks succeed than fail, you and any other character who contributed to the concert or production each gain a Theater die, a d6. This die changes to a d8 when you reach level 13 and a d10 when you reach level 17. At any point after the rehearsals end, a character can expend their Theater die to roll it and add the number rolled to one D20 Test they make, immediately after rolling the d20. If a character hasn’t expended their Theater die before gaining another, their first die is lost.

Research: Lore.
You commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic of your choice. The topic can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object.

The DM determines what information is learned.
Research: Trinket Trophy.
You commission the facility’s hireling to search for a trinket that might be of use to you. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, roll any die.

You start with two lieutenants but can add more, as described below. If your Bastion lacks facilities to house your lieutenants, they secure accommodations in the inn or settlement closest to your Bastion. Lieutenants are hirelings, not Bastion Defenders; however, if your Bastion is attacked (see “Bastion Events” at the end of this chapter), each lieutenant housed in your Bastion reduces by 1 the number of dice you roll to determine how many Bastion Defenders are lost in the attack.
The War Room contains war memorabilia plus a large table surrounded by enough chairs for you and your lieutenants.
Recruit Options.
When you issue the Recruit order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

You commission one or more of your lieutenants to assemble a small army. Each lieutenant can muster one hundred Guards (see the Monster Manual) in 7 days to fight for your cause. Reduce that number to twenty if you want them to be mounted on Riding Horses (see the Monster Manual). It costs you 1 GP per day to feed each guard and each horse in your army. Wherever the army goes, it must be led by you or at least one of your lieutenants, or else it disbands immediately. The army also disbands if it goes 1 day without being fed. Otherwise, the army remains until it is destroyed or you command it to disband. You can’t issue this Recruit order again until your current army disbands or is destroyed.

The visiting noble gossips about events and inhabitants in their home settlement, revealing to you the location of any creature familiar to you if that creature is within 50 miles of the settlement from which the noble has come, if that creature isn’t hidden by magic, and if that creature isn’t confined to a location that the DM deems beyond the noble’s ability to know. If the noble knows the location of the individual, they also tell you where that creature was for the 7 days prior to the noble’s departure for your Bastion.
The visiting noble won’t defend your Bastion and departs immediately if the Bastion is attacked.
Order of the Gauntlet Tournament Field
Level 9 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Membership in the Order of the Gauntlet
Space:
Vast
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Empower
The Order of the Gauntlet Tournament Field is a marked-off area for combat between two armed individuals. It includes room for spectators.
Your hireling is a Knight whose alignment matches your own. If your Bastion lacks facilities to house this knight, the knight secures accommodations in the inn or settlement closest to the Bastion. This knight isn’t a Bastion Defender, but if your Bastion is attacked, the knight reduces by 1 the number of dice you roll to determine how many Bastion Defenders are lost in the attack.
Empower: Hold Tournament.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you host a tournament at your Bastion. It takes 7 days for word of the tournament to spread to nearby settlements, and another 7 days for contestants to travel to your Bastion and participate in the tournament. You must spend 2,000 GP for prizes. At the conclusion of the tournament, your Renown Score with the Order of the Gauntlet increases by 1.
Red Wizard Necropolis
Level 5 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Membership in the Red Wizards, ability to use a Spellcasting Focus
Space:

Red Wizards defend their strongholds with Undead minions. A Red Wizard Necropolis can accommodate up to eight Bastion Defenders.
Recruit: Undead Defenders.
Each time you issue the Recruit action to this facility, up to four Undead Bastion Defenders are created and take shelter in the crypts and burial chambers of your Red Wizard Necropolis. You can’t issue the Recruit order to this facility if it’s fully occupied.
Keep track of Undead Bastion Defenders you lose and deduct them from your Bastion Defenders roster. An Undead Bastion Defender returns to your Red Wizard Necropolis 14 days after being destroyed. Undead Bastion Defenders can’t return from being killed if the facility is shut down or fully occupied.
Zhentarim Travel Station
Level 5 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Membership in the Zhentarim
Space:
Vast
Hirelings:
2
Order:
Research
The Zhentarim maintain stations to facilitate safe and swift long-distance travel on journeys (see chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Your travel station includes temporary stabling facilities for four Large creatures; two Medium creatures occupy the same space as one Large creature there. The facility’s hirelings look after these creatures.
Long-Distance Travel Speed.
Finishing a Long Rest in your Bastion better prepares you for travel; your group’s maximum travel pace increases by one step (from Slow to Normal or from Normal to Fast).
Research: Reconnaissance.
When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the Zhentarim Travel Station’s hirelings to gather information that facilitates an upcoming journey. This work takes 7 days. For the duration of the journey, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to forage or navigate.

Craft
An Artificer’s Forge includes two magewright hirelings who are skilled in creating magic items.
Crafting Assistants.
If you create a magic item in your Bastion using the rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, one or both of this facility’s hirelings can assist you, reducing the time required for the crafting.
Craft: Magic Item.
When you issue the Craft order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hirelings to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hirelings have proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. The two hirelings assist each other, reducing the time required to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, the hirelings have those spells prepared.
Charge Refreshment.
Whenever a magic item in your Bastion regains charges, it regains 1 extra expended charge.
Construct Forge
Level 17 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Ability to use Artisan’s Tools as a Spellcasting Focus

Recruit
A Construct Forge is used to create Constructs.
Recruit: Construct.
When you issue the Recruit order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hirelings to craft a Construct from the Forge Constructs table. The construction takes the time and costs you the amount listed in the table.
Constructs made in this facility count as Bastion Defenders. Deduct any you lose from your Bastion Defenders roster. You can choose not to count one or more of these creatures as Bastion Defenders, in which case they can’t be called on to defend the Bastion. Instead, they act in accordance with their nature and use their stat blocks in the Monster Manual.

Dragonmark Outpost
Level 5 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Renown 10+ with any dragonmarked house
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Empower
A Dragonmark Outpost is an area set aside for the use of your dragonmarked house. The hireling is a house agent and serves as a liaison between you and your superiors in the house.
When you add this facility to your Bastion, your Renown Score with your house increases by 1.
Dragonmark Empowerment (Requires Any Dragonmark Feat).
When you finish a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain one extra spell slot of level 2. You can use this spell slot to cast only a spell you have prepared because of a Dragonmark feat.
Empower: House Favor.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you instruct your hireling to call in a favor from your dragonmarked house. You can use any benefit of your house that your Renown Score affords you (as described in Eberron: Forge of the Artificer), and this favor doesn’t count against the total number of favors available to you. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until your Renown Score with your house increases.
Inquisitive's Agency
Level 13 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Research
This facility is an office for an inquisitive agency - either the headquarters of an agency you control or a branch office for a larger agency (such as Information Acquisition or Karr’Aashta’s Investigations, both of which are discussed in Eberron: Forge of the Artificer). Its one hireling is a secretary who maintains an extensive directory of useful contacts and helpful agents.
Research: Information Gathering.
When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the agency’s secretary to gather information from contacts and agents regarding a specific individual you designate, assembling a comprehensive picture of that person’s activities during the previous 7 days and over the course of the next 7 days, within 10 miles of your Bastion. Unless the DM deems that certain information is beyond these agents’ ability to uncover, you learn the following information:
Where the person is and has been staying
What they’ve spent money on
Whom they’ve met with
Where they’ve shown identification papers to the authorities
If your Bastion is mobile, it takes time to establish this network of agents in a new place. When your Bastion is traveling, you can’t issue the Research order to this facility. After it arrives at its destination, the first time you issue the Research order, this facility’s hireling spends 7 days establishing a new network, after which you can use the Research order normally.
Kundarak Vault
Level 9 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Renown 15+ with House Kundarak
Space:
Cramped
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Trade
A Kundarak Vault occupies space in your Bastion like any other special facility, but it is an extradimensional space that can be accessed from other places. As a Kundarak facility, it provides exceptionally secure storage for your trade goods and other treasures. Only you and your Bastion’s hirelings can open the vault door.
Kundarak Access.
Because the vault is an extradimensional space, you (and only you) can access its contents from any Kundarak bank facility in the world. These banks are found in cities across Khorvaire (and also in Stormreach, in Xen’drik).
Trade: Goods.
When you issue the Trade order to this facility, its hireling spends the next 7 days procuring nonmagical items that have a total value of 2,000 GP or less and stores them in the Kundarak Vault, or the hireling uses those 7 days to sell goods in the Kundarak Vault. You bear the total cost of any purchases, and the maximum value of the items purchased increases to 5,000 GP when you reach level 13.
When you sell goods from your Kundarak Vault, the buyer pays you 20 percent more than the standard price; this profit increases to 50 percent when you reach level 13 and 100 percent when you reach level 17.
Lyrandar Helm
Level 13 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Renown 25+ with House Lyrandar
Space:
Cramped
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Empower
A Lyrandar Helm allows a mobile Bastion built within an elemental airship or an elemental galleon to travel. This facility’s hireling is a dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar. On an elemental airship, the airship’s Helm crew station is part of this facility (see chapter 7).
Empower: Travel.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you instruct its hireling to pilot the Bastion to a destination you specify. The Bastion travels at the vehicle’s speed, 8 hours per day, for the duration of the Bastion turn. The Bastion stops early when it reaches the specified destination or if something happens to stop your travel.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, the DM rolls on the Bastion Events table as if you had issued the Maintain order to your Bastion.
Manifest Zone
Level 13 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Ability to use a Spellcasting Focus
Space:
Vast
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Empower
A Bastion with a Manifest Zone is infused with the planar energy of one of Eberron’s planes of existence. Choose the plane when you build this facility.
Empower: Manifest Charm.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, the facility’s hireling conducts magical rites for the next 7 days. At the end of that period, you gain a special Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in the Dungeon Master’s Guide) called a Manifest Charm, which lasts until you use it. You don’t need to be in the Bastion while the rites are performed to gain their benefit. The effects of the Charm depend on the facility’s linked plane:
Daanvi, the Perfect Order.
You can expend the Charm (no action required) to end the Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, or Poisoned condition on yourself.
Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead.
When you use a spell slot to cast a spell from the Necromancy school, you can expend the Charm (no action required) to treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.
Fernia, the Sea of Fire.
When you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals Fire damage, you can expend the Charm (no action required) to treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.
Irian, the Eternal Dawn.
When you use a spell slot to cast a spell that restores Hit Points or deals Radiant damage, you can expend the Charm (no action required) to treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.
Lamannia, the Twilight Forest.
When you use a spell slot to cast a spell that conjures or summons a Beast, an Elemental, or a Fey (including
Conjure Animals
,
Conjure Elemental
,
Conjure Fey
,
Conjure Minor Elementals
,
Conjure Woodland Beings
,
Find Steed
,
Summon Beast
,
Summon Elemental
, or
Summon Fey
), you can expend the Charm (no action required) to treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.
Mabar, the Endless Night.
When you use a spell slot to cast a spell that animates or summons an Undead (including
Animate Dead
,
Create Undead
, or
Summon Undead
), you can expend the Charm (no action required) to treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.
Risia, the Plain of Ice.
When you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals Cold damage, you can expend the Charm (no action required) to treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.
Shavarath, the Battleground.
When you score a Critical Hit, you can expend the Charm (no action required) to deal an extra 10 damage of one of the types dealt by the attack.
Syrania, the Azure Sky.
You can expend the Charm as a Bonus Action to gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed for 1 minute.
Thelanis, the Faerie Court.
When you cast a spell from the Enchantment or Illusion school, you can expend the Charm (no action required) to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.
Xoriat, the Realm of Delirium.
When you use a spell slot to cast a spell, you can expend the Charm (no action required) to roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player’s Handbook.
If your Bastion is mobile, its connection to the linked plane of existence is suspended while the Bastion moves, and you can’t issue the Empower order to this facility while it is in transit. When the Bastion reaches a destination, you can issue the Empower order to establish a new planar connection, linking the Bastion either to the same plane of existence or to a different one you choose. Establishing the new connection takes 7 days, after which you can issue the Empower order normally.
Museum
Level 13 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Roomy
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Research
A Museum contains relics and treasures brought back from expeditions you participated in or sponsored, carefully cataloged and displayed.
Research: Specialized Lore.
When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the hireling to study particular treasures in the museum. The work takes 7 days. The hireling gains knowledge regarding some question of ancient history as if they had cast the
Legend Lore
spell, then shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them.
Secrets of the Past.
Your Museum contains one treasure that gives you a magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in the Dungeon Master’s Guide) when you spend 7 days studying it and then finish a Long Rest in your Bastion. The Charm lasts for 7 days or until you use it. You can’t gain another Charm from this facility while you still have one. The effect of the Charm depends on the origin of the treasure in your Museum. You can choose one of the following options (your DM might make more options available or limit the existing options based on your past expeditions):
Charm of Argonnessen.
While you have this Charm, you know Draconic. You can expend the Charm to cast
Dragon’s Breath
(level 4 version), targeting yourself only.
Charm of Ashtakala.
While you have this Charm, you know Abyssal and Infernal. You can expend the Charm to cast
Ray of Sickness
(level 4 version).
Charm of Dhakaan.
While you have this Charm, you know the Goblin language. You can expend the Charm to cast
Staggering Smite
.
Charm of Khyber
. While you have this Charm, you have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet. You can expend the Charm to gain Truesight with a range of 60 feet for 1 minute.
Charm of Xen’drik.
While you have this Charm, you know the Giant language. As a Bonus Action, you can expend the Charm to change your Strength score to 25 for 1 hour.
Enlarging the Facility.
You can enlarge your Museum to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, the Museum can have two treasures with different origins. A Vast Museum gains two additional hirelings, for a total of three. Assign names and personalities to them as you see fit.
Navigator's Helm
Level 9 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
None
Space:
Cramped
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Empower
A Navigator’s Helm allows a mobile Bastion built within a mundane waterborne vehicle to travel.
Empower: Travel.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you instruct its hireling to pilot the Bastion to a destination you specify. The Bastion sails at the vehicle’s speed, 8 hours per day, for the duration of the Bastion turn. The Bastion stops early when it reaches the specified destination or if something happens to stop your travel.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, the DM rolls on the Bastion Events table as if you had issued the Maintain order to your Bastion.
Orien Helm
Level 9 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite:
Renown 15+ with House Orien
Space:
Cramped
Hirelings:
1
Order:
Empower
An Orien Helm allows a mobile Bastion built within a Lightning Rail cart to travel. This facility’s hireling is a dragonmarked heir of House Orien.
Empower: Travel.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you instruct its hireling to pilot the Bastion to a destination you specify. The Bastion travels at a rate of 30 miles per hour, 8 hours per day, along an existing route of conductor stones for the duration of the Bastion turn. The Bastion stops early when it reaches the specified destination or if something happens to stop your travel.
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, the DM rolls on the Bastion Events table as if you had issued the Maintain order to your Bastion.
Bastion Events
Immediately after a character issues the Maintain order to their Bastion, the DM rolls once on the Bastion Events table to determine what event, if any, befalls the Bastion before the next Bastion Turn. If an event occurs, the DM reads the event aloud to the player whose character controls that Bastion. (All the events are described in the sections following the table.) The event is resolved immediately, with the player and DM working together to expand story details as needed. If multiple characters issue the Maintain order on the same Bastion turn, roll once on the table for each of them, resolving each event separately even if the Bastions are combined.
Bastion events occur only when a Bastion is operating under the Maintain order, which often means that the Bastion’s owner isn’t present in the Bastion at the time. That means these events can be opportunities for the player to take on the role of the Bastion’s hirelings and roleplay their reactions to these events. The DM can even turn a Bastion event into a cutscene where each player takes on the role of one of the Bastion’s hirelings (under the guidance of the player whose character owns the Bastion).

All Is Well
Nothing significant happens. Roll on the following table, fleshing out the details as you see fit.
1d8
Details
1
Accident reports are way down.
2
The leak in the roof has been fixed.
3
No vermin infestations to report.
4
You-Know-Who lost their spectacles again.
5
One of your hirelings adopted a stray dog.
6
You received a lovely letter from a friend.
7
Some practical joker has been putting rotten eggs in people’s boots.
8
Someone thought they saw a ghost.
Attack
A hostile force attacks your Bastion but is defeated.
Roll 6d6; for each die that rolls a 1, one Bastion Defender dies. Remove these Bastion Defenders from your Bastion’s roster. If the Bastion has zero Bastion Defenders, one of the Bastion’s special facilities (determined randomly) is damaged and forced to shut down.
A special facility that shuts down can’t be used on your next Bastion turn, after which it is repaired and made operational again at no cost to you.
Criminal Hireling
One of your Bastion’s hirelings has a criminal past that comes to light when officials or bounty hunters visit your Bastion with a warrant for the hireling’s arrest. You can retain the hireling by paying a bribe of 1d6 × 100 GP. Otherwise, the hireling is arrested and taken away. If this loss leaves one of your facilities without any hirelings, that facility can’t be used on your next Bastion turn. The hireling is then replaced at no cost to you.
Extraordinary Opportunity
Your Bastion is given the opportunity to host an important festival or celebration, fund the research of a powerful spellcaster, or appease a domineering noble. Work with the DM to determine the details.
If you seize the opportunity, you must pay 500 GP to cover costs. In return, your Bastion gains a sudden influx of recognition or attention, prompting the DM to roll again on the Bastion Events table (rerolling this result if it comes up again).
If you decline the opportunity, you don’t pay the money and nothing else happens.
Friendly Visitors
Friendly visitors come to your Bastion, seeking to use one of your special facilities. They offer 1d6 × 100 GP for the brief use of that facility. For example, a knight might want your Smithy to replace a horseshoe or repair a damaged weapon or suit of armor, or sages might need your Arcane Study to help them settle a dispute. Their use of the facility doesn’t interrupt any orders you’ve issued to it.
Guest
A Friendly guest comes to stay at your Bastion. Determine the guest by rolling on the following table, and work with your DM to flesh out the details.
1d4
Guest
1
The guest is an individual of great renown who stays for 7 days. At the end of their stay, the guest gives you a letter of recommendation (see “Marks of Prestige”.)
2
The guest requests sanctuary while avoiding persecution for their beliefs or crimes. They depart 7 days later, but not before offering you a gift of 1d6 × 100 GP.
3
The guest is a mercenary, giving you one additional Bastion Defender. The guest doesn’t require a facility to house them, and they stay until you send them away or they’re killed.
4
The guest is a Friendly monster, such as a brass dragon or a treant. If your Bastion is attacked while this monster is your guest, it defends your Bastion, and you lose no Bastion Defenders. The monster leaves after it defends your Bastion once or when you send it away.
Lost Hirelings
One of your Bastion’s special facilities (determined randomly) loses its hirelings. The cause of their departure is up to you. The facility can’t be used on your next Bastion turn, but the hirelings are replaced at no cost to you at that point.
Magical Discovery
Your hirelings discover or accidentally create an Uncommon magic item of your choice at no cost to you. The magic item must be a Potion or Scroll.
Refugees
A group of 2d4 refugees fleeing from a monster attack, a natural disaster, or some other calamity seeks refuge in your Bastion. If your Bastion lacks a basic facility large enough to house them, the refugees camp right outside the Bastion. The refugees offer you 1d6 × 100 GP as payment for your hospitality and protection. They stay until you find them a new home or a hostile force attacks your Bastion.
Request for Aid
Your Bastion is called on to help a local leader. Perhaps there’s a search on for a missing person, or brigands are plaguing the area. If you help, you must dispatch one or more Bastion Defenders. Roll 1d6 for each Bastion Defender you send. If the total is 10 or higher, the problem is solved and you earn a reward of 1d6 × 100 GP. If the total is less than 10, the problem is still solved, but the reward is halved and one of your Bastion Defenders is killed. Remove that Bastion Defender from your Bastion’s roster.
Treasure
Your Bastion acquires an art object or a magic item determined by rolling on the table below and then rolling on the specified table in chapter 7. How the Bastion acquires this treasure is up to you. It might represent an inheritance, a gift from a guest or an admirer, a theft, or a fortunate discovery. If you’re in the Bastion, you can claim the treasure immediately; otherwise, it is placed in storage until you can claim it.
1d100

64-73
Roll on the 750 GP Art Objects table.
74-75
Roll on the 2,500 GP Art Objects table.
76-90
Roll on a Common Magic Items table of your choice (Arcana, Armaments, Implements, or Relics).
91-98
Roll on Uncommon Magic Items table of your choice (Arcana, Armaments, Implements, or Relics).
99-00
Roll on a Rare Magic Items table of your choice (Arcana, Armaments, Implements, or Relics).
Fall of a Bastion
A player character can lose their Bastion in the following ways:
Divestiture.
A character can give up their Bastion anytime, releasing the Bastion’s hirelings and abandoning the location. The divested Bastion is quickly vacated, is eventually looted, and might even be burned to the ground.
Neglect.
If a character issues no orders to their Bastion for a number of consecutive Bastion turns equal to the character’s level (typically because the character is dead or otherwise out of commission), the hirelings abandon the Bastion and the site is eventually looted. If the character returns later, they can start a new Bastion, perhaps building it amid the ruins of the old one.
Ruination.
Drawing the Ruin card from the
Deck of Many Things
instantly deprives a character of their Bastion. When such an event occurs, the player can decide what terrible fate befalls the Bastion. The Bastion might be sacked by enemies or destroyed by an earthquake, for example.
Regardless of how the Bastion falls, the player can work with the DM to establish a new Bastion and determine how it comes into being. Use the Special Facility Acquisition table to determine how many special facilities come with it. The new Bastion also starts with two basic facilities (one Cramped and one Roomy) of the player’s choice.
