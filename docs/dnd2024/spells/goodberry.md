<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can take a Bonus Action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 Hit Point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.
Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.
