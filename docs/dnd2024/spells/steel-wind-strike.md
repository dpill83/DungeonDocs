<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes 6d10 Force damage.
You then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets.
