You unleash a blast of brilliant fire. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range; a target gains no benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover for this attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 Radiant damage.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.
You create an additional blast for each spell slot level above 1. You can direct the blasts at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each blast.
