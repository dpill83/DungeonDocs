# Gentle Repose

Source: *Player's Handbook (2024)*

2nd Level Necromancy (Cleric, Paladin, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action or R
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (Pinch of salt or Copper coin (per eye))
Duration: 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become Undead.
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as
Raise Dead.
