# Homunculus Servant

Source: *Forgotten Realms Heroes of the Forgotten*

2nd Level Conjuration (Artificer)

Casting Time: 1 hour or R
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M(C*)
Duration: Instantaneous

You summon a special homunculus in an unoccupied space within range. This creature uses the Homunculus Servant stat block. If you already have a homunculus from this spell, the homunculus is replaced by the new one. You determine the homunculus’s appearance, such as a mechanical-looking bird, winged vials, or miniature animate cauldrons.

**Combat**  
The homunculus is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.**            
Use the spell slot’s level for the spell’s level in the stat block.

**Traits**  

**Evasion.** If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the homunculus instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the save and only half damage if it fails. It can’t use this trait if it has the Incapacitated condition.

**Magic Bond.** Add the spell level to any ability check or saving throw the homunculus makes.

**Actions**  

**Force Strike.** Melee or Ranged Attack Roll: Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft. Hit: 1d6 plus the spell’s level force damage.

**Reactions**  

**Channel Magic.** Trigger: You cast a spell that has a range of touch while the homunculus is within 120 feet of you. Response: The homunculus delivers the spell through its touch.
