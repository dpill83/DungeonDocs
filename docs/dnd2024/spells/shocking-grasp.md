Lightning springs from you to a creature that you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Lightning damage, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.
Cantrip Upgrade.
The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).
