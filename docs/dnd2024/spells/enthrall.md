You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature you or your companions are fighting automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, a target has a −10 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks and Passive Perception until the spell ends.
