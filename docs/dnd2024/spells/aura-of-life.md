# Aura Of Life

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic damage, and your Hit Point maximums can’t be reduced. If an ally with 0 Hit Points starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 Hit Point.
