# Conjure Volley

Source: *Player's Handbook (2024)*

5th Level Conjuration (Ranger)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (Ammunition or Arrow or Bolt or Thrown Weapon)
Duration: Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used to cast the spell and choose a point within range. Hundreds of similar spectral weapons (or ammunition appropriate to the weapon) fall in a volley and then disappear. Each creature of your choice that you can see in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high Cylinder centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
