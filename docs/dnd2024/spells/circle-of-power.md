An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. When an affected creature makes a saving throw against a spell or magical effect that allows a save to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the save.
