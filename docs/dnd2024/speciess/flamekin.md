Flamekin are people made from two key elements of creation: fire and stone. As a result, many flamekin feel a strong connection to the natural world. Flamekin’s bodies radiate harmless magical flames, though they possess innate magic that allows them to create burning flames in a multitude of forms.
Flamekin view self-discovery and self-expression the noblest of aspirations and believe that self-realization is the most important thing an individual can do with their life. Flamekin call this lifelong pursuit the Path of Flame.
Flamekin dwell in either Lorwyn or Shadowmoor. Physically and culturally, they are similar in both lands.
