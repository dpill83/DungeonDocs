# Boggart

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Boggarts are Small, squat goblinoids found in the realm of Lorwyn-Shadowmoor. They possess bestial physical features, including horns and animal-like snouts. Beyond these commonalities, boggart appearances vary widely. One boggart may look like a hedgehog, with spiky fur and beady eyes, while another might sport the snout and fleshy ears of a swine. Boggarts tend to love crafting potions and commonly gravitate to specific areas of expertise, as noted in the sections below.
In Lorwyn
Boggarts in Lorwyn are born into communal warrens where laws and hierarchies are considered suggestions. The oldest and most powerful boggarts, known as “aunties,” serve as respected leaders who keep the peace. Lorwyn boggarts value sharing knowledge and past experiences with their communities. Many are willing to brave great dangers in pursuit of new experiences, and adventurers are common.
Lorwyn boggarts also have a knack for magic. Boggarts who feel drawn to learning and using these natural affinities often become Druids. A Lorwyn boggart might alternatively find a calling as a Ranger, especially the Fey Wanderer subclass, or as a Wizard, especially the Diviner subclass, as boggarts have proven fond of ascertaining information through divination magic.
In Shadowmoor
Boggarts in Shadowmoor generally have sharper physical features than Lorwyn boggarts, including additional sets of horns. They are also known for body modifications, such as riveting armored plates to their flesh. Shadowmoor boggart society is chaotic and decentralized; their communities are few and likely to be found in isolated or dangerous environments. Aunties in Shadowmoor wander the lands, greeting those they meet with arbitrary tests, boons, or even curses.
Like their Lorwyn counterparts, Shadowmoor boggarts are drawn to magic. These boggarts might become Warlocks, particularly leaning toward the Archfey Patron subclass; some might believe their patron is Isilu. Others prove to be Sorcerers and are especially likely to manifest their power in the form of the Wild Magic Sorcery subclass.
