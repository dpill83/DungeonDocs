# Scion Of The Three

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


A Scion of the Three draws power from a group of malevolent gods known in Baldur’s Gate as the Dead Three: Bane, a god of tyranny; Bhaal, a god of violence and murder; and Myrkul, a god of death. While some Rogues of this subclass pledge themselves ardently to those three macabre gods, others are thrust on this path by a curse. Either way, a scion’s power manifests as various occult gifts, as well as an uncanny talent for striking and terrifying foes.
Scions of the Three are most common in Baldur’s Gate, where the Dead Three lived as mortals before ascending to godhood. Underground cults to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul often count Scions of the Three among their most useful agents. Outside Baldur’s Gate, secular thieves’ guilds such as the Shadow Thieves of Amn or the Xanathar Guild in Waterdeep might call on a Scion of the Three to undertake an especially violent contract.
Level 3: Bloodthirst
When an enemy you can see within 30 feet of yourself takes damage and is Bloodied after taking that damage but not killed outright, you can take a Reaction and teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of that enemy. You can then make one melee attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Dread Allegiance
Choose one of the Dead Three: Bane, Bhaal, or Myrkul. You gain Resistance to one type of damage and the ability to cast a cantrip, as detailed in the table below; Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip. When you finish a Long Rest, you can change your choice.

Level 9: Strike Fear
You gain the following Cunning Strike option.
Terrify (Cost: 1d6).
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While the target is Frightened in this way, you have Advantage on attack rolls against the target.
The Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Level 13: Aura of Malevolence
You radiate malignant power associated with one of the Dead Three. When you use Bloodthirst and teleport, each creature of your choice within 10 feet of either the space you left or your destination space (your choice) takes damage equal to your Intelligence modifier; the damage type is the same as the damage Resistance granted by your choice in the Dread Allegiance feature. Damage dealt by this feature ignores Resistance.
Level 17: Dread Incarnate
You gain the following benefits.
Cutthroat.
You regain one expended use of Bloodthirst when you finish a Short Rest.
Murderous Intent.
When you roll for your Sneak Attack damage, you can treat a roll of a 1 or 2 on the die as a 3.
