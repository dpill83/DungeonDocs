# Hunter Profane Soul

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Blood hunters belonging to the Order of the Profane Soul have pushed the limits of hemocraft for use against some of the most terrifying creatures corrupting the world. Ancient fiends and cruel magic-users have long counted on their ability to meld into the background and escape those who hunt them, vanishing into noble courts without a trace, or bending the minds of the most stalwart warriors with but a glance. So the blood hunters who founded this order trusted to their resilience as they delved into the same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater threats. And though they might have traded a part of themselves for their power, the members of this order know the benefits of that power far outweigh the price.

Otherworldly Patron
When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice:
Otherworldly Patron
Source
The Archfey
,
the Fiend
, or
the Great Old One
PHB
The Undying
SCAG
The Celestial
or
the Hexblade
XGE
The Fathomless
or
the Genie
TCE
The Undead
VRGR
The choice you make augments some of your subclass features, as noted below.
Pact Magic
When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. The spells you can learn can be found on the
Warlock spell list
.
Cantrips.
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
Spell Slots.
The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell
Witch Bolt
, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.
At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 13th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability.
Your chosen Hemocraft ability (Intelligence or Wisdom) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Hemocraft ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Hemocraft modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC
= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier.
Spell attack modifier
= your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier.
Rite Focus
Starting at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a conduit for the power of your pact with your chosen patron. While you have an active crimson rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact.
The Archfey.
When you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, that creature glows with faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature gains no benefit from any cover or from being invisible.
The Celestial.
As a bonus action, you expend one use of your Blood Maledict feature to heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).
The Fathomless.
You can breathe underwater. Additionally, once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can reduce that creature’s speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
The Fiend.
While using the Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die when you roll the extra damage from the rite, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.
The Genie.
As a bonus action, you expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round).
The Great Old One.
When you score a critical hit against a creature, that creature and any other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of it are frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
The Hexblade.
When you successfully target a creature with a blood curse, the next time you hit that creature with an attack while the curse is in effect, the attack deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier.
The Undead.
When you take necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage. In addition, your appearance changes to reflect some aspect of your patron while you have any crimson rite active.
The Undying.
When you reduce a hostile creature of at least mild threat (DM’s discretion) to 0 hit points, you regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.
Mystic Frenzy
Starting at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can immediately make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
