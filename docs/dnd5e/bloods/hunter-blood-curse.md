As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, causing its body to swell until the end of your next turn.

A creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target of your curse takes 3d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
Blood Curse of Exposure
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage from an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken its resilience. Until the end of the target’s next turn, it loses resistance to all the damage types dealt by the triggering attack or spell (including for that triggering effect).
Amplify.
The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, but has resistance to those damage types until the end of its next turn.
Blood Curse of the Eyeless
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack hits or misses. The creature is immune to this curse if it is immune to the blinded condition.
Amplify.
You apply this curse to all the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the creature’s turn. You roll separately for each affected attack.
Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to instill that creature with a final act of aggression. The creature immediately makes one weapon attack against a target of your choice within its range.

You can first cause the cursed creature to move up to half its speed, and you grant a bonus to its attack roll equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).

Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lycan
As an action, you unleash a bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.

The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.
Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind
