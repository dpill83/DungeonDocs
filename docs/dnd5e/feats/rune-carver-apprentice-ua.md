# Rune Carver Apprentice Ua

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You’ve begun studying the art of runecraft, which allows you to temporarily mark your items and imbue them with magic.
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can mark one nonmagical weapon, armor, piece of clothing, or other object you can touch with a rune of your choice. You temporarily learn one 1st-level spell based on the rune you choose, as specified in the Rune Spells table, and you know the spell until you finish a long rest, when the rune fades.

While you are wearing or carrying the rune-marked object, you can cast the chosen spell associated with the rune once without using a spell slot or material components, and you can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.
Your spellcasting ability for this feat is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you gain this feat).
