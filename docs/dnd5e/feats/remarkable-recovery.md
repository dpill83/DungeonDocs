# Remarkable Recovery

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Your body has the ability to recover quickly from terrible injuries, and is unusually receptive to healing magic. You gain the following benefits:
Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
When you are successfully stabilized while dying, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
Whenever you regain hit points as a result of a spell, potion, or class feature (but not this feat), you regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
