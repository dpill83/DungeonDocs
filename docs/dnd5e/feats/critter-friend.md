# Critter Friend

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Your friendship with animals mystically deepens. You gain the following benefits:
You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you’re already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.
You learn the Speak with Animals spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the Animal Friendship spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
