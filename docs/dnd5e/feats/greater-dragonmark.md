# Greater Dragonmark

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Your dragonmark has grown in size and power. This enhances your existing dragonmark, and the benefits are based on the mark that you already possess. A greater dragonmark provides the following benefits:
The die type of your dragonmarked Intuition Die increases by one (for example, from a d4 to a d6).
Increase one ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20. The abilities available to you are based on your mark, as shown on the Greater Dragonmark Benefits table.
You learn a set of spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot or using a material component. The list of spells, the spellcasting ability for them, and the type of rest you must complete to regain the use of these spells are shown on the Greater Dragonmark Benefits table.

Leomund’s Secret Chest
using this feat and the Mark of Warding, you must have a Siberys dragonshard with a value of at least 100 gp. While you have this dragonshard in hand, it serves as the spell’s focus, and you can use it to summon and dismiss the chest.
