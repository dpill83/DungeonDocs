# Drow High Magic

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the
Detect Magic
spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn
Levitate
and
Dispel Magic
, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
