# Fury Of The Frost Giant Ua

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You’ve manifested the icy might emblematic of frost giants, granting you the following benefits:
Born of Ice.
You have resistance to cold damage.
Frigid Vengeance.
When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to retaliate with a burst of magical ire. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be frightened of you until the start of its next turn. You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
