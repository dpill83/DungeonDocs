Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen
Prerequisite: 4th Level,
Squire of Solamnia
Feat
You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Sword, a group devoted to heroism and courage. Bravery steels your spirit, granting you these benefits:
Ability Score Increase
Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Demoralizing Strike.
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack roll, you can attempt to frighten that target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat). On a failed save, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
