You've learned secrets of hemocraft that grant you esoteric power at the price of your own life force. As a bonus action, you can choose to take 1d6 necrotic damage to gain a blood boon. Your blood boon lasts for 1 hour or until expended.
You can expend this blood boon to gain one of the following benefits:
When you make an attack roll, you roll 1d6 and add it to the total.
When you hit with an attack or spell, you deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage.
When you cause a creature to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, roll a d4 and reduce their save by the amount rolled.
The damage you take to gain a blood boon can’t be reduced in any way.
