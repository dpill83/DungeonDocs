# Rune Carver Adept Ua

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Your skill with the art of runecraft has increased.
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can now mark a number of objects equal to your proficiency bonus with a rune from the Rune Carver Apprentice feat. An object can have only one rune at a time, and you must inscribe a different rune on each object.
