# Wood Elf Magic

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one
Druid cantrip
of your choice. You also learn the
Longstrider
and
Pass Without Trace
spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
