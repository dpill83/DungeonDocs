Your extensive study of nature rewards you with the following benefits:
Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You gain proficiency in the Nature skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
You learn the
Druidcraft
and
Detect Poison and Disease
spells. You can cast detect poison and disease once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
