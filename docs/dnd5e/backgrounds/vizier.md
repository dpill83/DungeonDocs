# Vizier
<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

You are a vizier, a servant of your god. You perform tasks that are essential to facilitating the initiates’ journey, so the gods reward you with entry into the afterlife with the God-Pharaoh’s blessing. You hope to achieve the most honored status in the afterlife by being the best possible servant to your god.
As a vizier, you can have any class, but you are especially likely to be a cleric, a druid (particularly if you serve Rhonas), or a paladin.
