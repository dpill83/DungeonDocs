Source: Mulmaster Bonds and Backgrounds
You are one of the hundreds of small-time fishermen and -women who haul the bounty of Mulmaster's freshwater harbor to the city's markets each morning. You have spent countless days rowing in the waters in and around Mulmaster and know them and the other fisher folk, dockworkers, and port inhabitants better than anyone. Though you have left that life behind, you still visit once in a while.

The harborfolk remember you<br>still treat you as one of them. They welcome you<br>your companions. While they might charge you for it<br>they'll always offer what food<br>shelter they have; they'll even hide you if the City Watch is after you (but not if the Hawks are). Harborfolk Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I am curious. I want to know why things are the way they are<br>why people do the things that they do. 2 I can't sing<br>but that never stops me from doing it<br>loudly. Everyone loves a good sea shanty! 3 I think the High Blade is doing a terrific job<br>don't you? 4 I'm very excited that the House Built on Gold is being restored.

I see portents in everyday occurrences. 6 I resent the rich<br>enjoy thwarting their plans<br>spoiling their fun in small ways. 7 I have a sea story to fit every occasion. 8 I'm a fisher<br>but I secretly detest eating fish. I will do anything to avoid it. Harborfolk Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Calm. For all things<br>there is a tide. I set sail when it is right<br>and mend my nets when it is not. (Lawful) 2 Windblown. I go where the winds blow. No man or woman tells me where or when to sail. (Chaotic) 3 Aspiring. I will gain the favor of a Zor or Zora patron<br>maybe even one of the Blades! (Any) 4 Salty.

I'll get them back somehow<br>someday. 4 The High House of Hurting helped me when I was hurt<br>asked nothing in return. I owe them my life. 5 I was robbed in the Zhent ghetto once. It will not happen again. 6 I would do anything to protect the other harborfolk. They are my family. Harborfolk Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I drink too much<br>which causes me to miss the tide. 2 I killed a drunk member of the City Watch in a brawl.
