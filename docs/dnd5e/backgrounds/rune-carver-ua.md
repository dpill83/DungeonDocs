You’ve dedicated your life to studying the practice of runecraft. Whether you were personally taught by a master rune carver or learned by poring over engravings in ancient ruins, you understand how to tap into the supernatural power held within runes.
The art of runecraft was initially created by the giants of yore, but over time, the practice has been adopted by individuals of all races and backgrounds. As such, though Giant runes are the most common, many rune carvers incorporate symbols from their native languages into the craft.
