# Sailor
<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.
Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your DM. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?
What were your duties on board – boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run?

You've indulged in larceny on the high seas<br>sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear<br>bloodshed are no strangers to you<br>and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town. If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy<br>you can choose the Bad Reputation feature below instead of the Ship's Passage feature. Features Ship's Passage When you need to<br>you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself<br>your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on<br>or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor<br>you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your DM will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage<br>you<br>your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage. Alternative: Bad Reputation If your character has a pirate background<br>you may select this background feature instead of Ship's Passage. No matter where you go<br>people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement<br>you can get away with minor criminal offenses<br>such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop<br>since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.
