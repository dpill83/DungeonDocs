Backstory
A character's story begins with determining the region where they were born, the job they had before becoming an adventurer, their social status, the settlement where they grew up, and their family relationships. As this backstory develops, the character will gain allies and rivals, as well as learn some of the fateful moments that set them on the path of adventure.
Homelands
The Sword Coast and the North can be divided into five major political regions, each of which are described in chapter 2 of the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide. These regions are the Lords’ Alliance, the Dwarfholds of the North, the Island Kingdoms, Independent Realms, and the Underdark.
To determine your homeland, roll 1d100 on the Homelands table below. You may decide your character was born in one region but grew up in another. In that case, roll twice to determine the land of your birth and the land you were ultimately raised in.

Social Status
Even in lands as free as the Sword Coast and the North, most folk are trapped in their social station by forces they can’t control like wealth, family, and political power. Your story begins with you as a member of one social class, determined by your homeland and your background.

Once you've determined your nation and considered your social status within that realm, roll on the appropriate table to determine which settlement you grew up in. If your character is a traveller - a child of soldiers, a nomad, a travelling performer, and so forth - you can roll for up to three settlements that you've visited often and have some connections in.

Fateful Moments
No one decides to go adventuring without a reason. Some might set out from home in the name of vengeance, seeking retribution for themselves or their kin. Some might be looking for wealth or glory. Others might seek only a change from their dreary lives, never realizing that they'll soon be caught up in events beyond their understanding along the open road.
Roll once on the Fateful Moments table for each such moment you accrued in the previous section, courtesy of the allies and rivals that are part of your backstory.

Mysterious Secrets
d20
Secret
1
While traveling through Elturgard, I had a waking vision that the Companion which glows above Elturel was eclipsed and began to sink into the ground.
2
An agent of the Lords’ Alliance once begged my mother to “reconsider their offer,” but she spat in her face and said “that’s what I think of your offer!” I’ve seen strange people watching her ever since.
3
I remember growing up in a dank and dismal town of pirates called Skullport. My family escaped when I was a child, and we had to leave something very valuable behind. I’ve been trying to get back there ever since.
4
I discovered a passage to the Underdark that no one knows about while exploring in the woods. I see it in my dreams on strange nights—worse, I sometimes see things coming out of it, or climbing into it.
5
While sleeping in an inn in Waterdeep, I overheard a conversation through my window about a gold dragon living somewhere beneath the city. That can’t be right, though—the dragonward keeps all dragons out of Waterdeep.
6
A cleric of Tyr once sheltered in my home for the night. My parents let him stay. When I awoke, he was gone—and when I asked my parents when he had left, no one remembered his arrival.
7
I met a priest of Myrkul once on the streets of Baldur’s Gate. I was quickly pulled away, but not before she cackled and pointed at me, saying, “In time, the curse of death will claim you. It will claim everything!”
8
I stole from a beautiful Waterdhavian nobleman as a child, and later discovered that among the things I stole was his signet ring. I’ve seen wanted posters seeking the thief my entire life.
9
I lived for a year in Ten-Towns in Icewind Dale. One day while living there, a wild-eyed man grabbed me by the collar and shook me, demanding that I tell him where to find the Ring of Winter. His friend slapped his hand and told him I wasn’t the one he was looking for, and they quickly vanished down an alley.
10
One night, I discovered a golden coin with the face of a beautiful lady on one side. In the morning, the face was gone, and a leering, demonic face was there in its place. Whenever I try to get rid of it, I awaken with it in my pocket.
11
I was given a card from a mysterious street performer. It’s in black and white with a disturbing illustration. The card is labelled The Executioner.
12
I was saved from an angry bear as a child when a giant elk leapt in front of me. After it scared the bear off, the elk turned to look at me with such compassion it its eyes, I knew it must be a forest spirit, or even druid in an animal’s form.
13
I once overheard my parents saying that, when I was born, my father saw a group of drow with a strange Y-shaped mark on their foreheads gazing in through the window. I’ve seen that Y-shaped mark out of the corner of my eye my entire life, always disappearing when I look closely for it.
14
As a child, I once saw my father meet with a man in full plate armor and a face-covering helm, who called himself Pereghost. When I asked him who that was, he told me he was an old friend and quickly changed the subject. I’ll never forget the look of that armored man.
15
I have a vague memory that I joined a cult when I was young, and I have a tattoo shaped like the cult’s symbol on my bicep. I can’t remember anything else about it, and my head hurts when I try to remember it.
16
I was inducted into the Harpers when I was young, and I’ve been spying on the corrupt leaders in my hometown for years.
17
I found a dragon egg in the forest when I was young. I figure it must be a fake, since it’s never hatched over all these years. But I keep it safe and secret anyway.
18
While travelling along the Trade Way, I discovered a book from Candlekeep lying in the mud. No one else could see it, and when I opened it, all the pages were blank (save for the mark of Candlekeep on its inner cover). I’ve kept the book, but have never written in it.
19
I’ve heard the sound of waves crashing in my dreams for the past five years. Recently, they’ve gotten louder, and I can hear a sinister voice quietly speaking in a language I can’t understand underneath the sound of waves.
20
A paladin in the service of the Order of the Gauntlet killed my uncle for worshipping the evil god Bane. To this day, I don’t know if he truly worshipped dark forces or not.
Prophecy
Write down three aspirations or goals you have for your character, and which you want to achieve over the course of the campaign. A prophecy goal should have two parts. First is the goal that your character wants to attain. Second is a sense of what complication might ensue once the goal is met - for good or ill.
One of your prophecy goals should be an immediate goal, one should be long term, and one should be a goal that concludes your character arc at the end of the campaign. You don't have to choose all three goals at the start.
If you're looking for prophecy goals for your character, you can roll on the Prophecy Inspirations table for a random goal and a consequence of that goal. If this goal isn't a perfect fit for your character, you can fine-tune it or roll again to find one that works better.
Prophecy Inspirations

Prophecy
1
I will uncover a deep corruption at the heart of the Lords’ Alliance. However, this will destabilize the alliances that unify the Sword Coast, inviting even greater danger.
2
I will slay a dragon that has terrorized the North for ages, but this will draw the greed of leaders across the land.
