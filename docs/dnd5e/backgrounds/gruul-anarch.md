# Gruul Anarch
<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist - the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins. You are part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways - attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization's march of progress.

Suggested Characteristics Gruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk<br>and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions<br>values<br>just as important to them as the different values held by the urban<br>cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 Unlike people<br>the beasts of the wild are friends who won't stab me in the back. 2 Go ahead<br>insult me - I dare you. 3 I scorn those who can't survive away from the comforts of the city. 4 Don't tell me I'm not allowed to do something. 5 Laws are for people who are afraid to face their inner beasts. 6 I smear the blood of my enemies over my skin. 7 I was<br>in fact<br>raised by maaka. 8 HarrRRAAGGHH! [I rarely form a coherent sentence<br>prefer to express myself by breaking things.] Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Clan. My clan is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Anarchy. No person or law or custom can tell another what to do. (Chaotic) 3 Nature. We weren't born tame or domesticated<br>so we shouldn't have to live that way. (Neutral) 4 Might. The strongest are meant to dominate the weak. (Evil) 5 Rage. AAAAAARRRRggggh! [To live is to feel<br>express the rage burning in your belly.] (Chaotic) 6 Tradition. The Old Ways must be preserved<br>upheld. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I am determined that one day I will lead my clan - or a new one. 2 I would give my life for my clan chieftain. 3 The chieftain of another clan has a grudge against me. 4 I am devoted to a sacred site in the midst of the rubblebelt. 5 My weapon is made from the first raktusk I ever hunted. 6 GrrrRRAAAAGGHH! [I will do anything to prove myself greater than my siblings or ancestors.] Flaws d6 Flaw 1 If you question my courage<br>I will never back down. 2 HrrrGGGAAAARRuuuh! [My anger in battle led to the death of a loved one.] 3 I'm as stubborn as a batterboar. 4 I'm so convinced of my superiority over soft<br>civilized people that I'll take great risks to prove it. 5 I'm easily manipulated by people I find attractive. 6 I'm not actually all that angry. Contacts The members of the Gruul Clans rely on each other even as they vie for territory<br>glory. Their encounters with members of other guilds are more often violent than friendly<br>but occasional bonds do form. Roll twice on the Gruul Contacts table (for an ally<br>a rival)<br>once on the Non-Gruul Contacts table. Gruul Contacts d8 Contact 1 One of my parents is a renowned warrior in my clan. 2 My sibling has the ear of the clan chief. 3 I have cousins in a different clan. 4 When we were younger<br>I was romantically involved with a prominent warrior in my clan. 5 A druid in my clan believes I have a destiny to fulfill. 6 The warrior who trained me remembers me for my exceptional potential. 7 My clan chief killed one of my parents<br>who had challenged the chief for leadership of the clan. Some combination of resentment<br>remorse stirs the clan chief to help me sometimes. 8 I made a strong impression on Borborygmos. Non-Gruul Contacts d10 Contact 1 An Azorius arrester thinks I can be reformed. 2 A Boros soldier gives me gifts in exchange for information about other clans' movements. 3 I once caught<br>released a Dimir spy. 4 I consult with a Golgari shaman for spiritual guidance at times. 5 Roll an additional Gruul contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival. 6 An Izzet scientist blames the Gruul for the destruction of his life's work in a raid<br>but seems to think that I'm not like other Gruul. 7 I foolishly borrowed money from an Orzhov syndic to indulge a shameful vice. 8 A close friend left our clan<br>joined the Cult of Rakdos. 9 A distant relative is trying to recruit me into the Selesnya Conclave. 10 I stopped a Simic biomancer from trapping wild beasts to perform vile experiments on them. |
