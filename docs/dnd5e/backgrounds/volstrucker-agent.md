# Volstrucker Agent
<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

The Volstrucker are a clandestine organization of arcane assassins and enforcers in the service of the Cerberus Assembly. Their operatives bear no official title, but are referred to in hushed tones as "scourgers" by residents of large Dwendalian cities such as Zadash and Rexxentrum.
You are a Volstrucker agent. Your duty is to silence dissidents who would undermine the will of King Dwendal - and more importantly, the will of the Assembly.

The Cerberus Assembly preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy - in some cases<br>tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped<br>reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path<br>or roll on the Tragedies table. d6 Tragedies 1 Familicide. Through deceit or manipulation<br>the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family. 2 Amnesia. You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits<br>stealing away the memories of your past. 3 Capture. You were captured<br>tortured by agents of the Kryn Dynasty<br>barely escaped. 4 Starvation. A terrible blight afflicted your rural village<br>and many of your friends<br>family members starved to death. You survived<br>but only barely. 5 Disfigurement. One of your arcane experiments went wrong<br>scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day. 6 Vicissitude. You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye. Shadow Network You have access to the Volstrucker shadow network<br>which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you write a letter in special arcane ink<br>address it to a member of the Volstrucker<br>and cast it into a fire<br>the letter will burn to cinders<br>materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to. The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10gp per page. Suggested Characteristics Agents of the Volstrucker are groomed to follow orders without question<br>to kill without mercy. The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a Volstrucker agent's assignments. Officially<br>no one ever leaves the order - but those desperate enough to do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom.
