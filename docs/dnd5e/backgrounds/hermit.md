<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

You lived in seclusion – either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone – for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.

Discovery The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique<br>powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos<br>the deities<br>the powerful beings of the outer planes<br>or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten<br>or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile<br>and hence the reason for your return to society. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery<br>its impact on the campaign. Suggested Characteristics Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion<br>whereas others chafe against it<br>long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it<br>the solitary life shapes their attitudes<br>ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak<br>preferring gestures<br>the occasional grunt. 2 I am utterly serene<br>even in the face of disaster. 3 The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic<br>and I am eager to share that wisdom. 4 I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer. 5 I'm oblivious to etiquette<br>social expectations. 6 I connect everything that happens to me to a grand<br>cosmic plan. 7 I often get lost in my own thoughts<br>contemplation<br>becoming oblivious to my surroundings. 8 I am working on a grand philosophical theory<br>love sharing my ideas. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all<br>not used for my own benefit. (Good) 2 Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right<br>true<br>or our logical thinking. (Lawful) 3 Free Thinking. Inquiry<br>curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic) 4 Power. Solitude<br>contemplation are paths toward mystical or magical power. (Evil) 5 Live<br>Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral) 6 Self-Knowledge. If you know yourself<br>there's nothing left to know. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage<br>order<br>or association. 2 I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them. 3 I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion<br>and it still eludes me. 4 I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have. 5 Should my discovery come to light<br>it could bring ruin to the world. 6 My isolation gave me great insight into a great evil that only I can destroy. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 Now that I've returned to the world<br>I enjoy its delights a little too much. 2 I harbor dark<br>bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation<br>meditation failed to quell. 3 I am dogmatic in my thoughts<br>philosophy. 4 I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships<br>harmony. 5 I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge. 6 I like keeping secrets<br>won't share them with anyone. Other Hermits This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study<br>prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people<br>look at the Outlander background. On the other hand<br>if you want to go in a more religious direction<br>the Acolyte might be what you're looking for. Or you could even be a Charlatan <br>posing as a wise<br>holy person<br>letting pious fools support you. |
