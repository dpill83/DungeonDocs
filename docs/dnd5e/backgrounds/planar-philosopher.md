# Planar Philosopher
<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

You subscribe to a philosophy that seeks to understand the nature of the planes or some hidden truth of the multiverse. You draw strength from your conviction and, perhaps, a network of like-minded thinkers, such as the factions of Sigil (summarized below). In your travels, you explore the depths of your understanding and spread your philosophy wherever you go.
