# Trade Sheriff
<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

You are one of the many people that make sure the trade routes are clear at ALL times. You assure that the
Great Law of Trade
is followed at all costs. You work by yourself or in groups to quell bandits and brigands who might stop trade routes from going through. You investigate potential ambushes and possible rumors as to someone wanting to rob or stop caravans. You are as much an investigator as you are law enforcement.
You are able to go into a town/village around the Hillsfar area and find a contact that is willing to give you information from rumor to fact. This sometimes comes at a cost of a minor bribe of 1-9 silver pieces.
