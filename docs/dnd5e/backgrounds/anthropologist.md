You have always been fascinated by other cultures, from the most ancient and primeval lost lands to the most modern civilizations. By studying other cultures' customs, philosophies, laws, rituals, religious beliefs, languages, and art, you have learned how tribes, empires, and all forms of society in between craft their own destinies and doom. This knowledge came to you not only through books and scrolls, but also through firsthand observation – by visiting far-flung settlements and exploring local histories and customs.

Adept Linguist You can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day<br>after which you learn a handful of important words<br>expressions<br>and gestures – enough to communicate on a rudimentary level. Suggested Characteristics Anthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life ls like in other parts of the world.
