# Secret Identity
<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->

Even though you are a non-human, despite Hillsfar's Great Law of Humanity, you continue to live in the City of Trade. You do so by maintaining a secret identity, forging documents, and even wearing a disguise. Few, if any, know you aren't human.
If you're a halfling or a gnome, you pass as a little person or a child. If you're a half-elf, half-orc, or genasi, you disguise your non-human features. Other races use a combination of disguise and concealing clothing to hide.
Your reasons for doing so are your own. Perhaps you're a great dissident or the agent of a foreign power. Maybe you have a relationship with someone you cannot bear to leave. Regardless, this way of life has taken a heavy toll on you.
