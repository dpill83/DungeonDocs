Suggested Characteristics
You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.
Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause.
The "Knightly Orders of Faerûn" section below details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.

Other knightly orders serve a government<br>royal family<br>or are the elite military of a feudal state<br>such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular<br>non-governmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy<br>or consider themselves a kind of extended family<br>similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations<br>such as the Knights of the Shield<br>that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors<br>most folk of Faerûn who hear the word "knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. Knights of the Unicorn The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons<br>daughters of patriar families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark<br>they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot<br>went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in<br>as did Lurue's tenets. Over time the small group grew<br>spread<br>gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished<br>lived with laughter<br>quests should be taken on a dare<br>impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion<br>and everyone should be praised for their strengths<br>comforted in their weaknesses. Knights of Myth Drannor Long ago<br>the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band<br>and Dove Falconhand<br>one of the famous Seven Sisters<br>was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city<br>just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins<br>Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances<br>friendship between the civilized races of the world<br>goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands<br>and they've begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members<br>each accepted by Dove herself<br>are above all valiant<br>honest. Knights of the Silver Chalice The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the nobility's right<br>responsibility to rule<br>and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time<br>the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr<br>reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr<br>a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown. Knightly Regard You receive shelter<br>succor from members of your knightly order<br>those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one<br>you can gain aid from temples<br>other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community – whether a lone settlement or a great nation that they serve<br>and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals<br>and those who share those ideals. This help comes in the form of shelter<br>meals<br>and healing when appropriate<br>as well as occasionally risky assistance<br>such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight<br>or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly. Suggested Characteristics Use the tables for the Soldier background as the basis for your traits<br>motivations<br>modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity. Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it)<br>and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda<br>sentiment<br>or philosophy of one's order. |
