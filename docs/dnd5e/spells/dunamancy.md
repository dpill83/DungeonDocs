# Dunamancy

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


The esoteric powers developed and harnessed through the use of dunamis are still very much a rare and carefully guarded feature of the Kryn Dynasty in Wildemount. However, such arcana is hard to keep hidden, especially in times of war. Spies and defectors have long smuggled out the secrets of this obscure magical practice, and even now it slowly disseminates beyond Xhorhas.
Dunamancy spells are readily available to the
Chronurgy
and
Graviturgy
subclasses and should not be simply added to the full spell lists of other spellcasting classes. However, the Dungeon Master can consider allowing other spellcasting classes opportunities to learn a handful of dunamancy-themed spells as rewards. Perhaps the characters uncover a cache of magical contraband, among which is a couple of spell scrolls, or a traveling acolyte takes some downtime with a friendly cleric character and opens their mind to some of the stranger secrets of the universe, unlocking a spell or two. There are many unique ways to bring these spells into your game without requiring any specific dunamis-wielding subclasses to be present in the adventuring party.
