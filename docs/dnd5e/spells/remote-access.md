# Remote Access

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


You can use any electronic device within range as if it were in your hands. This is not a telekinesis effect. Rather, this spell allows you to simulate a device's mechanical functions electronically. You are able to access only functions that a person using the device manually would be able to access. You can use remote access with only one device at a time.
