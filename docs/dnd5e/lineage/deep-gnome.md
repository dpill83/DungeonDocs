Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse
Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, are natives of the Underdark and are suffused with that subterranean realm’s magic. They can supernaturally camouflage themselves, and their svirfneblin magic renders them difficult to locate. These abilities have enabled them to survive for generations among the perils of the Underdark.
Like other gnomes, deep gnomes can live for centuries, up to 500 years.
Ability Score Increase.
When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.
Creature Type.
You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a gnome for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a gnome.
Size.
You are Small.
Speed.
Your walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision.
You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
Gift of the Svirfneblin.
Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the
Disguise Self
spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the
Nondetection
spell with it, without requiring a material component. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
Gnomish Magic Resistance.
You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against spells.
Svirfneblin Camouflage.
When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you can make the check with advantage. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Languages.
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The
Player’s Handbook
offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
Elemental Evil Player's Companion
Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins.
Ability Score Increase.
Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.
Age.
Gnomes mature at the same rate as humans, and most are expected to settle into adult life around the age of 40. They can live to 350 years on average, but it's not too uncommon for them to reach 500 years of age.
Size.
Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh around 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
Speed.
Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
Superior Darkvision.
