# Tiefling

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus, overlord of the Nine Hells (and many of the other powerful devils serving under him) into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.

Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide
Variant Tiefling
Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the
Player's Handbook.
The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive.
Appearance.
Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the
Player's Handbook
, choose 1d4 + 1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goat-like legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.
Feral.
Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. This trait replaces the Ability Score Increase trait
Devil's Tongue.
You know the
Vicious Mockery
cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the
Charm Person
spell once as a 2nd-level spell. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the
Enthrall
spell once. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait
Hellfire.
Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the
Burning Hands
spell once as a 2nd-level spell. This trait replaces the
Hellish Rebuke
spell of the Infernal Legacy trait.
Winged.
You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulders. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.
Unearthed Arcana
Abyssal Tiefling
Source: Unearthed Arcana 11 - That Old Black Magic
All abyssal tieflings trace their bloodline to the demons of the Abyss. These tieflings have the following additional features.
Ability Score Increase.
Your Constitution score increases by 1.
Abyssal Arcana.
Each time you finish a long rest, you gain the ability to cast cantrips and spells randomly determined from a short list. At 1st level, you can cast a cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast a 1st-level spell. At 5th level, you can cast a 2nd-level spell.
You can cast a spell gained from this trait only once until you complete your next long rest. You can cast a cantrip gained from this trait at will, as normal. For 1st-level spells whose effect changes if cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you cast the spell as if using a 2nd-level slot. Spells of 2nd level are cast as if using a 2nd-level slot.
At the end of each long rest, you lose the cantrips and spells previously granted by this feature, even if you did not cast them. You replace those cantrips and spells by rolling for new ones on the Abyssal Arcana Spells table. Roll separately for each cantrip and spell. If you roll the same spell or cantrip you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.
Abyssal Fortitude.
Your hit point maximum increases by half your level (minimum 1).
Languages.
You can speak, read, and write Abyssal.
