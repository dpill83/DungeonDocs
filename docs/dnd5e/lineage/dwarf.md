Player's Handbook
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs – these common threads unite all dwarves.

Your Constitution score increases by 2.
Age.
Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
Speed.

Plane Shift: Kaladesh
Dwarves don’t understand laziness or shortcuts. Just as a machine must function smoothly at all times, so too an artisan should work steadily and with care. Dwarves take pride in their work ethic, and abhor any attitude or behavior that would undermine the quality of their work. They are more thorough than speedy, and although a dwarf’s work might take longer to complete, its quality makes the time worthwhile. If a job must be done, a dwarf will see that it is done correctly. And when a dwarf repairs a machine, it will work as well as it did when it was first built, if not better — and it will last.
