Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse
Shifters are sometimes called weretouched, as they are descendants of people who contracted full or partial lycanthropy. Humanoids with a bestial aspect, shifters can’t fully change shape, but they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features by entering a state they call shifting.
Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter’s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.
Most shifters resemble a particular kind of lycanthrope. You can choose the kind of lycanthrope in your past, or you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Lycanthrope Ancestor table. The table also provides a suggestion for the Shifting option you might have as a result of your ancestry.

Ability Score Increase.
When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.
Creature Type.
You are a Humanoid.
Size.
You are Medium.
Speed.
Your walking speed is 30 feet.
Bestial Instincts.
Channeling the beast within, you have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, or Survival.
Darkvision.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
Shifting.
As a bonus action, you can assume a more bestial appearance. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action. When you shift, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 x your proficiency bonus. You can shift a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Whenever you shift, you gain an additional benefit based on one of the following options (choose when you select this race):
Beasthide.
You gain 1d6 additional temporary hit points. While shifted, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
Longtooth.
When you shift and as a bonus action on your other turns while shifted, you can use your elongated fangs to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with your fangs, you can deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
Swiftstride.
While shifted, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a reaction when a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This reactive movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
Wildhunt.
While shifted, you have advantage on Wisdom checks, and no creature within 30 feet of you can make an attack roll with advantage against you unless you’re incapacitated.
Languages.
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The
Player’s Handbook
offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
Eberron - Rising from the Last War
Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features – a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife’s edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?
Beasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn and thick-skinned.
Longtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.
Swiftstride are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.
Wildhunt shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.
Age.
Shifters are quick to mature both physically and emotionally, reaching young adulthood at age 10. They rarely live to be more than 70 years old.
Alignment.
Shifters tend toward neutrality, being more focused on survival than concepts of good and evil. A love of personal freedom can drive shifters toward chaotic alignments.
Size.
Shifters range from 5 to almost 7 feet tall, depending on their subrace. Your size is Medium.
Speed.
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision.
You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Shifting.

You also gain benefits that depend on your shifter subrace, described below. Once you shift, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
Languages.
You can read and write Common.
Subrace.
The beast within shapes each shifter physically and mentally. The four major subraces of shifter include beasthide, longtooth, switftstride, and wildhunt. Choose a subrace for your shifter.
Beasthide
Stoic and solid, a beasthide shifter draws strength and stability from the beast within. Beasthide shifters are typically tied to the bear or the boar, but any creature known for its toughness could apply.
