Source: Unearthed Arcana 85 - Wonders of the Multiverse
Created by forces of planar law, glitchlings are winged, human-like creatures made from a merger of magic and machine. These explorers seek to learn all they can about the multiverse and its creatures. Some glitchlings then carry what they learn back to lawful planes, like Mechanus, to inform the orderly working of the multiverse. Others become enamored with travel and the peoples they encounter, and they seek to make a life of their own among the planes.
Glitchlings begin their existences with rudimentary personalities. As they absorb information and experiences, their personalities grow, but many retain quirks associated with their lawful origins. You can roll or choose a quirk from the Orderly Quirk table or create your own.

1
I collect things, whether a specific kind of object or things made of a particular material.
2
We think of ourselves as being part of the collective, lawful forces of the multiverse and don't refer to ourselves as a singular being.
3
I seek out new experiences so I can better understand the freedom of my existence.
4
I preface things I say with a short description, such as: "observation," "interjection," or "query."
5
I plan elaborate responses to every contingency, ready to execute on an instant's notice.
6
I investigate people's intentions behind their actions, trying to solve the equation that guides them.
