A ram consists of a movable gallery equipped with a heavy log suspended from two roof beams by chains.
The log is shod in iron and used to batter through doors and barricades.
It takes a minimum of four Medium creatures to operate a ram. Because of the gallery roof, these operators have total cover against attacks from above.
