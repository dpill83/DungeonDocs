In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival.

Each warrior focuses on offense or defense in their training. Choose one of the following options:
Attacker.
The sidekick gains a +2 bonus to all attack rolls.
Defender.
The sidekick can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll of a creature within 5 feet of it whose target isn't the sidekick, provided the sidekick can see the attacker.
Second Wind
2nd-level Warrior feature
The sidekick can use a bonus action on its turn to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + its level in this class. Once it uses this feature, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.
The sidekick can use this feature twice between rests starting at 20th level
Improved Critical
3rd-level Warrior feature
The sidekick's attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
Extra Attack
6th-level Warrior feature
The sidekick can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action on its turn.
The number of attacks increases to three when the sidekick reaches 15th level.
If the sidekick has the Multiattack action, it can use Extra Attack or Multiattack on a turn, not both.
Battle Readiness
7th-level Warrior feature
The sidekick has advantage on initiative rolls.
Improved Defense
10th-level Warrior feature
The sidekick's Armor Class increases by 1.

The sidekick can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 18th level.
