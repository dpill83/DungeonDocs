# Rings Of Shared Suffering

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


, you can use a bonus action to form a link to the creature attuned to the other ring; from then on, whenever that creature suffers damage, they only suffer half of that damage and you take the rest. This effect continues until you end it as a bonus action or until you or the other creature removes their ring. This effect isn't limited by range. A creature cannot be attuned to more than one ring of shared suffering.
