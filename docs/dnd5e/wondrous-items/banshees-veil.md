# Banshees Veil

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
This amulet is shaped like a sword with a small ruby set in the crossguard. Once per day when you are the target of a spell you can use a reaction to cast
Counterspell
(using your spellcasting ability). Casting
Counterspell
in this way does not expend a spell slot.
