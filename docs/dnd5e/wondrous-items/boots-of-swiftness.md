# Boots Of Swiftness

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


These fashionable boots are adorned with small white wings. While you wear these boots your base walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be restrained.
