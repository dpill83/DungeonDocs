# Reincarnation Dust

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


When this small pouch of purple dust is sprinkled on a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid, the dust is absorbed by the remains. If willing, the dead creature returns to life with a new body as if the
Reincarnate
spell had been cast on the remains.
