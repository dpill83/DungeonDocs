# Mirror Of Infinite Transpondence

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


These silver hand mirrors always come in pairs. When activated as an action, a mirror establishes a visual link with its paired mirror for 10 minutes, with the two mirrors acting as opposite sides of the same open window. The mirrors create this connection even if both are on different planes. When a single
mirror of infinite transpondence
is found, the GM decides where its paired mirror is and who possesses it. A random possessor and location can be determined by rolling on the table below.
