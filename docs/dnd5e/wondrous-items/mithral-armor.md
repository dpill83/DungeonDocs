# Mithral Armor

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
