<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This burnished copper breastplate looks as if it were made of interlocking gears. Merchant’s scales are emblazoned across the chest.
The armor has 4 charges. You can use the charges in the following ways while wearing the armor:
Equalize.
When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can expend 1 charge and take a reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.
Expunge Imbalance.
As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the
Lesser Restoration
spell from the armor.
The armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
