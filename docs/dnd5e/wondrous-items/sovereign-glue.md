<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with
Oil of Slipperiness
. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of
Universal Solvent
or
Oil of Etherealness
, or with a
Wish
spell.
