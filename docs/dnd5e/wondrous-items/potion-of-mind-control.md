Potion, rarity varies
When you drink a
Potion of Mind Control
, you can cast a
Dominate
spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.
A
Potion of Mind Control
produces the effect of a
Dominate Beast
, a
Dominate Person
(humanoid), or a
Dominate Monster
spell (see the table below). If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no concentration required on your part. The charmed creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
