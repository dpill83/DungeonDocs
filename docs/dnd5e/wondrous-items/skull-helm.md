<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


While wearing this skull-shaped helm, you have resistance to cold, poison, and necrotic damage.
Additionally, while wearing the helm, you can cast
Spirit of Death
from it without requiring material components. Once you use the helm to cast the spell, the helm can’t cast this spell again until the next dawn.
