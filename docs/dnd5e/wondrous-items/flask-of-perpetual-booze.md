# Flask Of Perpetual Booze

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


When opened and poured, this flask produces up to one gallon of dark, brackish whiskey. Once emptied, the flask refills in one hour. Any whiskey poured from this flask that isn’t consumed within eight hours turns into brine.
