# Pyroconverger

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


is an Izzet-made flamethrower. It carries a risk of malfunction each time you use it.
As an action, you can cause the
pyroconverger
to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Each time you use the
pyroconverger
, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the
pyroconverger
malfunctions: you take 4d6 fire damage, and you can't use the
pyroconverger
again until you finish a long rest.
