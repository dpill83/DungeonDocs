# Pressure Capsule

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This small capsule is made of beeswax blended with sand and a variety of enchanted water plants. A creature who consumes a
pressure capsule
ignores the effects of swimming at depths greater than 100 feet (see "Unusual Environments" in chapter 5 of the
Dungeon Master's Guide
).
