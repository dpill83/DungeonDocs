Curse.
This item is cursed. While it is on your person, you take a -2 penalty to ability checks and saving throws. Until the curse is discovered, the DM secretly applies this penalty, assuming you are adding the item's bonus. You are unwilling to part with the stone until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic.
