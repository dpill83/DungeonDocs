# Brazier Of Commanding Fire Elementals

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the
Conjure Elemental
spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
