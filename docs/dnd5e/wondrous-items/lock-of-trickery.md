# Lock Of Trickery

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This lock appears to be an ordinary lock (of the type described in chapter 5 of the
Player's Handbook
) and comes with a single key. The tumblers in this lock magically adjust to thwart burglars. Dexterity checks made to pick the lock have disadvantage.
