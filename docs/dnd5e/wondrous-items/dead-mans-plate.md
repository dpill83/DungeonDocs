This jagged armor is made of castaway hooks and barbs. While wearing this armor, if you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you. The shoved creature takes 1d8 piercing damage, in addition to either being knocked prone or pushed.
