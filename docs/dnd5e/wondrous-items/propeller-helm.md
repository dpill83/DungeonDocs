Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a small humanoid)
While worn, the helm allows its wearer to cast the
levitate
spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50 percent chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
