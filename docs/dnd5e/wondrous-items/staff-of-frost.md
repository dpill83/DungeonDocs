# Staff Of Frost

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)
You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.
The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:
Cone of Cold
(5 charges),
Fog Cloud
(1 charge),
Ice Storm
(4 charges), or
Wall of Ice
(4 charges).
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
