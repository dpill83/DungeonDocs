# Spire Of Conflux

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of Ashari leaders, the Spire of Conflux was lost over three centuries ago when Joran the Sea-Speaker, a respected leader of the Water Ashari, was devoured by a demon of the Abyss. It was rediscovered by the legendary druid Keyleth of Zephrah, Voice of the Tempest. However, rumors swirl that she is seeking another hero to wield it — one who can travel the land and do good in small ways as she once did.
