# Deck Of Miscellany

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This wooden box contains a set of thirty-two parchment cards.
The face of each card bears an illustration of a different item or set of items. As an action, you can draw a card of your choice from the deck and throw it to the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself. When the card hits the ground, the card permanently transforms into the item or set of items depicted on its face. An altered deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck, as shown on the Deck of Miscellany table.
