# Stone Of Controlling Earth Elementals

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the
Conjure Elemental
spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. This stone weighs 5 pounds.
