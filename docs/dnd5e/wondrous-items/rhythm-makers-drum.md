While holding this drum, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your bard spells. The bonus is determined by the drum's rarity.
As an action, you can play the drum to regain one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature. This property of the drum can't be used again until the next dawn.
