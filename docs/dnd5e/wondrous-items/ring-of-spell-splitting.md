# Ring Of Spell Splitting

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


A gold and a silver band spiraling around each other in a single loop.
When the wearer casts a spell that targets a single creature, the wearer can target one additional creature. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
