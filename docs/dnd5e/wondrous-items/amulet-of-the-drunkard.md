# Amulet Of The Drunkard

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This amulet smells of old, ale-stained wood. While wearing it, you can regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you drink a pint of beer, ale, mead, or wine. Once the amulet has restored hit points, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
