When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). This potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.
This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The
potion of frost giant strength
and the
