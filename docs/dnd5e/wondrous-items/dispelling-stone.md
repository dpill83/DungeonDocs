# Dispelling Stone

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This smooth, rainbow-colored, egg-shaped stone can be thrown up to 30 feet and explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of magical energy on impact, destroying the stone. Any active spell of 5th level or lower in the sphere ends.
