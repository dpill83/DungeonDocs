# Smokepowder

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


is a magical explosive chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a firearm. It is stored in airtight wooden kegs or tiny, waterproof leather packets. A packet contains enough
Smokepowder
for five shots, and a keg holds enough
Smokepowder
for five hundred shots.
If
Smokepowder
is set on fire, dropped, or otherwise handled roughly, it explodes and deals fire damage to each creature or object within 20 feet of it: 1d6 for a packet, 9d6 for a keg. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.
Casting
Dispel Magic
on
Smokepowder
renders it permanently inert.
