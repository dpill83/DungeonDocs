# Mind Blade

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement by a specific individual)
Mind flayers can turn any nonmagical sword into a
mind blade
. Only one creature can attune to it: either a specific mind flayer or one of its thralls. In the hands of any other creature, the mind blade functions as a normal sword of its kind. In the hands of its intended wielder, the mind blade is a magic weapon that deals an extra 2d6 psychic damage to any target it hits.
