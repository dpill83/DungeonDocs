# Flying Chariot

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


The chariot's riders and creatures pulling the chariot gain a +1 bonus to their AC.
If this magic chariot is pulled by one or more flying creatures, it too can fly.
Chariots
Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the
Player's Handbook
, but with the following differences:
Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.
Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.
A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.
If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.
