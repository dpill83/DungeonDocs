<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


A rugged, leather belt containing multiple loops and small sheathes that can hold up to four weapons. Any such weapon with the thrown property that is held in the belt and then thrown by the wearer is magically transported back to this belt directly after the attack.
