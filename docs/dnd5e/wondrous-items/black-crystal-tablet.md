# Black Crystal Tablet

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


Source - Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage
Wondrous Item, Legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has proficiency in the Arcana skill)
Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
As an action, a creature attuned to the
Black Crystal Tablet
can use it to cast
Eyebite
or
Gate
(the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
