# Pole Of Angling

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


While holding this 10-foot pole, you can speak a command word and transform it into a fishing pole with a hook, a line, and a reel. Speaking the command word again changes the fishing pole back into a normal 10-foot pole.
