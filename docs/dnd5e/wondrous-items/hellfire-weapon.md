# Hellfire Weapon

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


This weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.
Any humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil (described in the
Monster Manual
).
