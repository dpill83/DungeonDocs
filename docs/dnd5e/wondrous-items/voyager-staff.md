You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.
This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:
Banishment
(4 charges),
Blink
(3 charges),
Misty Step
(2 charges),
Passwall
(5 charges), or
Teleport
(7 charges).
The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.
