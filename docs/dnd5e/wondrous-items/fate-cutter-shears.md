# Fate Cutter Shears

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


The blades of these pruning shears bear many nicks and dents but still cut cleanly. The shears function as a magic dagger. The weapon has the following properties:
Ever Sharp.
When you hit with an attack using the shears, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage.
Sever Threads.
When you hit a creature with the shears, you can cut that creature’s fate. Until the target finishes a long rest, attack rolls against it score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
