# Rod Of Hand Warming

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


The Rod looks like a staff about three to four feet long with a seam in the middle as if it were two pieces joined. It is faintly magical and acts like a hand warmer. When the two parts are slid together and click, the metal emanates enough heat to warm the hands of whoever's holding it.
