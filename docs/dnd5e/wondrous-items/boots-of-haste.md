# Boots Of Haste

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


While you wear these boots, you can click your heels together to cast the
Haste
spell on yourself as a bonus action. You don't suffer from lethargy when the spell ends when cast using these boots. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
