# Mage Of Quandrix Ua

<!-- generated-by: scripts/txt_to_mkdocs.py v2026-02-03 -->


For those who become Mages of Quandrix, math and magic go hand-in-hand. Such individuals learn to break down natural phenomena into their core numerical components and, through manipulating those, alter reality on a whim. Their talents range from tangible physics, like multiplying plant growth and redistributing elements of probability and acceleration, to bizarrely theoretical exercises that warp the fundamentals of space and self.

Using This Subclass
Upon selecting the Mage of Quandrix subclass, you gain two features: Quandrix Spells and Functions of Probability.
In this subclass’s features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you’re a sorcerer, the magic of Quandrix is part of your sorcerous origin, and if you’re a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.
When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.
Quandrix Spells
Level 1+ Mage of Quandrix Feature
You learn the cantrip
Guidance
and the 1st-level spell
Guiding Bolt
. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Quandrix Spells table.
Each of these spells counts as a class spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. If you are a wizard, you can add these spells to your spellbook upon learning them, without expending any gold, and prepare them as normal.

Functions of Probability
Level 1+ Mage of Quandrix Feature
By iterating on the mathematical patterns of reality, you can nudge chance to tilt around a creature. When you cast a spell using a spell slot that targets at least one creature, you can choose that creature or another creature within 30 feet of it (including yourself) and add one of the following effects:
Diminishing Function.
The chosen creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or the creature must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the next attack roll it takes before the start of your next turn.
Supplemental Function.
Once before the start of your next turn, the chosen creature can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to an attack roll or a saving throw of its choice. The creature can roll the d6 after rolling the d20 but must decide before any effects of the roll occur.
Velocity Shift
Level 6+ Mage of Quandrix Feature
You learn to manipulate kinetic formulas and alter the velocity of another creature. When a creature you can see starts its turn or moves to a space within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail. On a failure, the creature is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.
You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Null Equation
Level 10+ Mage of Quandrix Feature
Through careful calculations, you beset your enemies with abstract equations that reduce their might. Once per turn, immediately after dealing damage to a creature, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and its weapon attacks deal only half damage. These effects last until the start of your next turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Quantum Tunneling
Level 14+ Mage of Quandrix Feature
Your mathematical expertise extends to altering the foundational equations of your very being. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
Additionally, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you move while inside another creature or object. If you end your turn inside a creature or an object, you are shunted into the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.
