Tongue of the Dragon
Feats as Draconic Gifts
The death of a dragon can result in its power taking root in a character, whether that person is the dragon's chosen heir or the dragon's killer. The result of this investiture can vary widely in power and impact, from a minor charm to a complete transformation.
Sometimes, a draconic gift has an obvious visual manifestation, such as when a character is transformed into a dragonborn. Other gifts are invisible, but no less potent. But on some worlds, the investiture of draconic power is accompanied by some kind of physical manifestation, especially if it's derived from slaying a dragon. It might be small and easily hidden, but those who know to look can usually identify a dragonslayer (or another character who carries a draconic gift) by a telltale sign. The Draconic Marks table suggests some possibilities of what these marks might look like.
Draconic Marks
d4
Visual Manifestation
1
One or both of the character's eyes change color to resemble the dragon's eyes or scales.
2
The character's hair (or a streak of it) changes color to match the color of the dragon's scales.
3
A mark like a stylized dragon eye or claw appears on the body.
4
Patches of scales appear on the character's body, typically on the neck, shoulders, or forearms.
Draconic Gift Descriptions
The draconic gifts detailed in this section have rarities like magic items. The rarity of a draconic gift corresponds roughly to the age category of the dragon that bestowed it, as shown in the Draconic Gift Rarity table.
You can use a more common draconic gift for an older dragon, but exercise caution going in the other direction. Very rare and legendary draconic gifts can unbalance the game if they're given to low-level characters.

Draconic Familiar
Draconic Gift, Uncommon
You gain the aid of a draconic familiar, which might be a splinter of the consciousness of a dragon that invested you with power.
You can cast the
Find Familiar
spell as a ritual without using any material components. When you cast the spell in this way, your familiar always takes the form of a pseudodragon.
Additionally, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your pseudodragon familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
Draconic Rebirth
Draconic Gift, Uncommon
You become a dragonborn. You replace the racial traits of your original race with the traits of a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragonborn. The kind of dragonborn you become matches the family of the dragon that is the source of this gift. You can keep any skill proficiencies you gained from your previous race, or you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.
Draconic Senses
Draconic Gift, Rare
You gain keen senses like a dragon's.
Blindsight.
You have blindsight to a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see invisible creatures within that range, unless the creatures successfully hide from you.
Keen Senses.
You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.
Echo of Dragonsight
Draconic Gift, Very Rare
You have begun to extend your awareness beyond the single world of the Material Plane that is your home.
You can cast
Contact Other Plane
as a ritual. The entity you contact is a dragon on another world in the Material Plane, so its knowledge of your world might be limited. Also, this dragon is an echo of the dragon who is the source of the gift, which might affect its attitude and behavior toward you.
Frightful Presence
Draconic Gift, Very Rare
Echoes of a dragon's might linger around you, and you can call on them to inspire fear in those who stand against you.
As a bonus action, you can manifest your frightful presence. Each creature of your choice that is within 120 feet of you and aware of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. A creature that fails becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
Psionic Reach
Draconic Gift, Very Rare
The psionic energy of a gem dragon empowers your mind. You gain resistance to psychic damage.
In addition, you learn the
Telekninesis
spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spellcasting ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma when you cast the spell with this gift (choose when you gain the gift).
Scaled Toughness
Draconic Gift, Legendary
Your skin toughens, making you resistant to certain types of physical harm. You gain resistance to piercing and slashing damage.
Tongue of the Dragon
Draconic Gift, Uncommon
You gain some of the majestic presence of a dragon.
Dragon's Speech.
You can speak, read, and write Draconic.
Dragon's Voice.
As a bonus action, you can make your voice audible up to 300 feet away for 1 minute.
Dragon's Wiles.
You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
