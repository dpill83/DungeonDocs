Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature you choose in the Emanation makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 5d6 Thunder damage and 5d6 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the Prone condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.
